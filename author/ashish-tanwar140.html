                <p>a 'black swan event'</p>
<p>she is not just talking economics - it is the trifecta of power - money, muscle and vision</p>
<p>lets ignore the grand 'intents' of g_baldies or baldies in general </p>
<p>// though its simple - money++, fame++ -&gt; laid_$++ = approval/success</p>
<p>the 'hack' in this alfred, compliance algo is simple - the exit condition - retirement or 'gyaan gurus' - the universal mentors</p>
<p>In reality,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there is no 'value' left, no ideas, just 'experience' of living a day over and over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>value in $$ : inflation, perception and assets - all relative to next alfred++</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>this is always a losing battle - based on larger pattern of 'recursion' - called habits/traits of an alfred </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the ultimate $$ psy hack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now i have more $$ than i can consume, what todo with $$++?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>investing is really the downfall for an alfred - money shows what ppl really are</p>
<p>-cars</p>
<p>-houses</p>
<p>-gadgets</p>
<p>-vacations/affairs</p>
<p>-cool stuff - material/emotional</p>
<p>how does this 'black swan' connect to 'blahBlah"?</p>
<p>"Intellectual impotence" - normalized, accepted and celebrated as part of 'success' - 90s 'pioneers' did 'invest' similarly.</p>
<p>'invest' - a grossly misunderstood yet manipulated term. Like everything, it is relative.</p>
<p>this 90s mass 'intelligence' has 'scaled'.</p>
<p>to me, a stray wolfie - it simply means karma </p>
<ul>
<li>of all 90s grads wagging their tails to western toilet paper - it made them feel 'clean'</li>

<p>imho, baldies, inc me  and their 'success/invaluable contribution' to whatever is not going to make much sense to next gens - tiktokies and instas - too cool to notice, too proud to admit - it is all there on 'youtube/ fav influencer' etc.</p>
<p>all part of "future"</p>
<p>.. who needs few out of rhyme/trends baldies who dont even know who pogan laul is - his cool drinks, unkle billy's rescue efforts, climate change, vax, need to darken the sun - elders are all part of it...they approve.</p>

<p>The rational voices are getting lesser or classified "delusional" - diff flavors of it - sad, poor, fired, 😂 etc</p>
<p>Just glad that there are people like Whitney Webb who still have the "freedom" to put their perspective through</p>
<p>What if if asking "why" was prohibited ? thats like the matrix scene in which neo loses his mouth...</p>
<p>that is part of the plan - watch her explain, if you are getting tired of 'delusional unkle's rants' 😀</p>

<p>though i seem to be making a joke out of few baldies - in truth they do have few good qualities - some v v skilled...yet $$ motivation and 'comfort' keeps them 'kings' of their ponds - some of them are quite big....their hope seem to be sell out when $$ comes up - it is just work routing on 'priority' really - sometimes its code, sometimes its ppl - its really doesn't matter as long as the smiles are there after a 'release'</p>

                <p>the tai/chi ladder</p>
<p>prelude:</p>
<p>as you go baldie, like me in delusional midlifecrisis mode....</p>
<p>simple things in life tend to take a priority</p>
<p>sunday, good/bearable air - the sun god blessing like it always tries to...</p>
<p>so lets write some more imaginary delusional stuff which never happened</p>
<p>story:</p>
<p>i wasnt a baldie then</p>
<p>i just knew that i knew nothing - working in wessee - debugging hardware, oscilloscopes and all, without any help of internet - makes a good engineer out of you - a pure 1</p>
<p>Yet, the $$ salary was less, and my real mentor had to xfer for official reasons.</p>
<p>no learning, just few piddies trying to become 'leaders' after the real leader was gone.</p>
<p>So i went $$ - telco startup</p>
<p>I dint knew 'fine life' then...wessee is a very humble environment - your are humbled everyday with people who are good at what they do - coz mostly they 'want' to deliver - in best defense culture - overlooking few things, sidestepping most. - Rs 7 lunch and 2x v v creamy tea..</p>
<p>Telco Startup 1</p>
<p>work was good.</p>
<p>ppl were good</p>
<p>mentors were awesome </p>
<p>till  eno &lt; 100</p>
<p>then Tai Chai ladder was invented - the better way to 'live'</p>
<p>I dont know about health - none of them had any diameter_delta--</p>
<p>but then, its function was something else...</p>
<p>i was really tech++ then - ugly and all, only trying to make up for $$, 'status+=0' after loss of my father then.</p>
<p>Then, after a few years of really working - i realized what tai-chai was really was :</p>
<p>-an enlightenment quest</p>
<p>-buddhas qualify for it</p>
<p>-skip work, or choose work or make time - to become a leader</p>
<p>and few did - they dint deliver any projects or anything...the did try though...</p>
<p>wimax - was a sure shot bet</p>
<p>android - we were the 'pioneers'</p>
<p>apps - coolest telco apps ever made..</p>
<p>it was existing amongst the gods.</p>
<p>Learn tai-chai anons </p>
<ul>
<li>see the 'perception', the cheap gyaan sold off as 'management knowledge' - the alfreds of society - rich ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>I dint learn tai- chai, i think Dhalsim doesnt represent now, it represented an Indian being judged for not being an alfred</p>
<p>Now- how does it matter ??</p>
<p>delusions cant manifest sucess - i am delusional - someone wrote it in an official communication - so cant deny it...</p>
<p>as always - u see what u want to see.</p>

<p>here - i ported roms, to new boards, version++, sometimes drivers - simple ones...</p>
<p>made a framework sold off multiple times - a mentor claimed to have 'invented' it, and I merely helped him</p>
<p>...a mentor sold out for corner office, a childs tantrum, and then doubling up on the seniority++ by acting like 5 footiya nickeodean version of godfather</p>
<p>i took pity - really.</p>
