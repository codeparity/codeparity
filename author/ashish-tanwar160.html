                <p>The "Key"</p>
<p>To debug yourself:</p>
<p>Understand and quantify the "emotion"</p>
<p>eg - right now </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why this guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does he ever work...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the emotion - curiosity, hate, lurv etc</p>
<p>and i am all those things 😀 </p>
<ul>
<li>but lets make it about "debugging"</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did 1 feels that - the reason and logic is the key</p>
<p>the thought process goes like this</p>
<p>hate</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i hate his face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate cox a 0 cannot be "right" - brand always is "company, religion, leader etc"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate the "disrespectful-ness"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to sum it up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pause, take a breath</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask the "why"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>see - no going to a "quiet" place or "being holy" and all -effienet and hacky as you would like it - engages - the Neo brain (conscious thinking) over impulse.</p>
<p>As an engineer - understanding "why" - to the level of perception i have - was satisfying.</p>
<p>The logic "whys" - the layers to which 1 can debug himselves - the bigger Neo he becomes (Neo-cortex) something which evolves vs the very physical, literal lizard brain we all have.....</p>
<p>//he is delusional , still why i am i reading this??</p>
<p>// ask the "why"</p>

<p>sometimes, it is just sad - a g_baldie_1 craving for fame, emotion - never had in school, college, pro_life - ever</p>
<p>now - u got "nice" women - going all 😂 😂 </p>
<p>and aww - the 1" intellectual thing - the rockstar / pink floydm  logging it out - corp version of "angst" - highs, which may be "unconquered" if humble leaders like us, dont make time to play "Comfortably numb" - at 6:00 PM - friday evening </p>

<p>an unsolved nutritional/cultural "why" which the doctors, leaders of the world - never debugged, just accepted.</p>

<p>I ll call it "religion" because "religion" is essentially a social protocol which establishes "trust" between people.</p>
<p>The beliefs of this religion would override each and every piece of habitus values any employee may imbibe (economic, religious, abilities, appearance - quantified equality)</p>
<p>And i will quantify them - as i build and commercialize "paw" - open source, self maintainable - build by people with "values".</p>
