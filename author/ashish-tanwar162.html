<p>Stadia/Gaming - Alfred Pichai's "booger" of 5G gaming dint stick </p>
<p>Real nerds are ppl who fake passions...</p>
<p>Gaming - Anyone who ever really went beyond "offline" or even had courage to walk into "arcades", would know how R/T, reliability is the key parameter.</p>
<p>But here we have a nerd who thought </p>
<p>"Cloud + Gaming" = winner üòé </p>
<p>The casteist/regional/mummy pappa recommended "colleagues" rejoiced - YAY üòç </p>
<p>Booger can do no wrong - unsaid mass consensus.</p>
<p>So we "had" Stadia 2019 - build for future ( shud be now )</p>
<p>It can only get better - they said!</p>
<p>Oh it did - they threw money, bought influencers</p>
<p>The booger still dint stick</p>
<p>4 years of money pump</p>
<p>Including the golden "corona" time</p>
<p>The average reaction time to visual stimulus is around 250 milliseconds</p>
<p>dns 3 ms</p>
<p>tcp ~20 ms</p>
<p>data bw ~ 20 mbps kinds - hevc and all</p>
<p>latency, jitter - real world "things"</p>
<p>considering - they are all "envisioned" to use 5G....higher freq bands - low penetration, specially in denser areas - where cityfolk - a typical gamer lives</p>
<p>No technikal googley this - alfred pichai really aimed for a "moonshot" - a 10x thing</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "stadia" controller itself - is a wireless thing...</p>
<p>the public bandwidth...is really not a space to conduct realtime business...</p>
<p>they invented whole standards for real timeness - mil -1553 etc...just to eliminate frame retransmissions</p>
<p>muggers...they expose themselves....getting those 99% would mean u had no social life - arcade or gaming was viewed more like "casino for kids" or "bad kids hang out there" or "jua/gambling"</p>
<p>v safe assumption that the kind which designed "stadia" never really gamed - just a nerd who "imagined" a "PD" - the nepotistic environment - just go üëç on the most successful alfred of India.</p>
<p>-a fan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>layers - tcp retransmissions bring uncertainty for the gamer</p>
<p>Frame redraws - on top of a game's own online mechanism coping algos - delay, loss, wifi - local connectivity adaptations...</p>
<p>this was just an amazing thought process...worked out wonders</p>
<p>A fan of work of pichai!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gaming - is really the future in many wef sense, as well as in common sense.</p>
<p>It is an opportunity...would unfold later. now making "mooonnneeyyy"</p>

<p>One of the "disrespectful" or mini dharma lessons are learnt in arcade/streets in my days:</p>
<p>In arcade - the age/size dint matter - it was the joystick and buttons which anyone can press - or get skilled at</p>
<p>As the kid who found this fascinating -  a whiz kid at video games ..but consequences were real, in streets...baldies..and their egoes...</p>
<p>It dint matter then - kinda became local legend in local arcade circles.</p>
<p>The lessons remained - some ppl live that life - Daigo, Tokido, Momochi and they excel - inspire</p>
<p>We - the Indian stray kind - go to code for Brit masters....</p>
<p>Times - they  sure change.</p>

<p>My only problem with Big Tech employees is purely logical.</p>
<p>They are supposed to be "smart", but most of them dint saw this coming, and most importantly - are not "googley" enough to deal with it.</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dfzBcVi3</p>
<p>Nepotism - the leadership, has very real consequences - we are just witnessing people who are suffering due to it. </p>
<p>The real "bharatRatnas" - they know, they plan.</p>
<p>X - they are all going down - the smartest ppl on planet.</p>
<p>this was way way evident - 2 years back - to even a "backbencher", "NI", stray like me.</p>
<p>Karma : the true "interest / %" comes due. Money is just an approximation of "value"</p>
<p>To GBaldies - "abracadabra"!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>logic of all of this</p>
<p>I ve seen "good" people choosing silence/inaction due to repercussions of speaking out - money, in many forms</p>
<p>The reason i shared my origins - for most of my life, i was made to believe that what my grandad did - was not necessary and evil</p>
<p>Ppl were divided - no one dared asked my Grandad, but judgements were made</p>
<p>Those judgements influenced a lot of ppl - me too</p>
<p>I chose way of my father - education - whatever drew my interest</p>
<p>I saw a division of an idea of "Hindu/Indian" - which had extreme bearing on me</p>
<p>We are reliving the same choice - all of us</p>
<p>Option - this wont and cant happen</p>
<p>I have seen stories, things which i was told to be not proud of...but then, education and morales - they dont seem to apply to green ppl - just the taxpayers - the ppl who slog it out to provide for..</p>
<p>yet, just a sheep </p>
<ul>
<li>money and its value is too apparent to - ppl in kashmir, now israel and some alive ancestors in Delhi too </li>
</ul>
<p>Our former PM (Pv Narasimha Rao) made a very beautiful statement - not making a decision is also making a decision</p>
<p>conversely - not speaking out is also a decision.</p>
<p>silence only emboldens the bully - a former bully knows.</p>
