<blockquote>
<p>in the neighbourhood that formed my base layer - values....a stranger trying to offer candy to a kid was rarely spotted again</p>
<p>it wasnt a relative or a cop...everyone looked after everyone...electricity wasnt reliable as the people</p>
<p>now. the rich pedos can convince people that their kids can be taught touched by pedo teacher - they call it progress</p>
<p>it gets "likes" cox the guy saying it has money</p>
<p>do i need these people - for anything? fun, learning or just for recognition??</p>
<p>naah...most of them call me to get guidance for working for pedos...even former "mentors"</p>
<p>??</p>
<p>a rebirth is needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the awesome part is the change in "value" of money, hence our self worth (assumed) or real (stray life)</p>
<p>Money was always a tool to measure "value"</p>
<p>"genius" ppl thought otherwise.</p>
<p>super genius ppl put their pups up for "mensa tests" - to put a target on back of their kids even before they can decide...</p>
<p>capitalism and sheep at its finest.</p>
<p>sheep have a "biblical" fate...</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my predecessors - optimistic/brave/unknown ....they trusted society too much ...</p>
<p>i dont share that optimism... time needs to be respected,</p>
<p>it in turn means being patient, watch the true religion - money, and its effects on various people </p>
<p>money - has different forms - influence, relative/perceived beautify and the mass truth/hysteria/hopium ppl are wishing for...</p>
<p>to defeat this matrix...one has to truly win on these individual matrices..financial, spiritual and material....</p>
<p>as i tried sharing earlier - hacking is an art, which is much older than computers.</p>
<p>a good hackers knows the layers and the entry/exchange point of protocols between these layers.</p>
<p>brit masters - learn from them - a true homage to a master, yet a true test of evolution </p>
<p>Akuma's birth - goki was happy in his final moments - his success was his pupil's success - a true test...a conclusion of a successful life.</p>
<p>Akuma, like money is not evil or good - it just serves a purpose. </p>

<p>I am not a religious guy.. for me - Sanatan or base Hinduism is actually living logically or aesthetically</p>
<p>No religion is really "sanatan".</p>
<p>The caste/division thing is a nepotistic pattern - inbuilt into any parent - to make sure their kids have a better chance</p>
<p>it is really a perspective build on illusion of "scarcity"...</p>
<p>and if you really look into past 10-15 years...- the world has been food sufficient - only to be constrained by fake $ and the "generosities" of billionaires</p>
<p>the rulers need a divide - and they had and used many - color, creed, religion, nationality etc.... </p>
<p>fun fact - passports were an invention of "world wars" - which one may argue - were directly or indirectly fuelled and needled by all knowing masters in london - following vatican.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The canada thing - should be the confirmation of the unfortunate, illogical, invisible, yet very real "war" we are part of</p>
<p>a side which wants to claim humanity hacking its nihilistic/animistic tendencies - coz morality is so out of fashion...ai, lowering age of consent etc is the way to go...</p>
<p>the other side...which has always been defending with "jugaad" - survival with whatever gratitude one can offer</p>
<p>the war which largely people of the world are blind to...and thats is the real reason unique cultures are a threat to '15 min cities"/universal capitalistic harmony/safe/provided for/free money and hence - freedom</p>
<p>we are in a war - and it is sort of biblical... i dont think many people are aware of it...hence this.</p>

<p>Lets follow the timeline here</p>
<p>once upon a time, Vatican made its mission to spread religion to the globe</p>
<p>it largely succeeded </p>
<p>the ppl in hollywood decide -" religion is so 70s" (just after gold standard was abolished")</p>
<p>for the 1st time - the church is OK with all the computer revolution and the free educative videos out there...</p>
<p>then the universal basics of morality - the 7 sins were phased out and made fun of</p>
<p>now - with vax, tax and unemployment - it is quite predictable - ppl wont even be able to speak their mind online - leave apart the real world where ppl already live for society approval with loans and cars of "amazing" value.</p>
<p>ppl with pent up anger and anxiety: with no way of dealing with it....fentnyl makes sense now - this is not at all predictable</p>
