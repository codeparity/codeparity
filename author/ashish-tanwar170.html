<p>I think a lot of ppl on linkedin aspire to work for BigTech someday...</p>
<p>yeah - maybe u will </p>
<p>either you skill up so no "genius" can defy logic or manners</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>you find a professional sugar daddy in one of these companies</p>
<p>there is no other way - best real advise u would never find anywhere</p>
<p>I never really cared...i thought i would...but then i dint</p>
<p>gaming - thats where future is - wef says so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Purpose thing is real....else i would be wagging my stray tail to boomer baldies and their HCL/Oraclite hall of fame of wisdom...</p>
<p>and the "leaders" of the world would be liking "vax, esg, dei" and your/my kid...would already be theirs - in mental and maybe in physical sense - true Orwellian fantasy realized in CA by fentynl and these "geniuses" who are insecure to burn 18 hours in office - to scheme and plot their "empires"</p>
<p>....the kids would rather like a dad/mom with a big house/car..</p>
<p>yours might - my wont. </p>
<p>no one is genius enough to say this - i will.</p>
<p>btw - the level of question at booglie cloud : which port does a dns server run on??</p>
<p>wow - the ppl who made search engine asking memory based question...</p>
<p>it seems "genius" but how else would you get in your hcl intellect ppl in?</p>
<p>that too selected via casteism/nepotism...</p>
<p>it works when there is no work.</p>

<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "trans" thing works on various levels of capitalism</p>
<p>-money flows: med makes money from "grants/taxes"</p>
<p>-opium for next gens...keep them consumed in 1 organ and its uses  - CN is opium example, this one is dopium one...no resistance when families/communies are broken</p>
<p>-psy/op - divide and control of "repelleous"(rebel+repel)  kids</p>
<p>teens are known to get along with parents- historical fact</p>
<p>so they wont be tempted to "oppose" each and everything their "out of tune" parent might say...</p>
<p>they never leave home or do things just to "tick off" authority figures</p>
<p>so this law and people who dream it...dont really know how the "feelings of few" might be conflicting with "feelings of the majority tax payer - who is busy passing "dei" compliance for his bigtech employer..and they do have those "sessions" where they hunt the people to speak on "pressing issues"</p>
<p>money really sets you free.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Billy is yet to even say "oopsie" for vax</p>
<p>indian alfred wont ever admit being a party to covid misinformation or suppression (he might have to - contris to dems...)</p>
<p>media "ken" would use "cn" as proxy to "abstract" the dirty business of clean energy - cobalt, lithium or battery is not a generator</p>
<p>intelligent or evil - it is just a perspective... üòÄ </p>
<p>they are rich, so intelligent and well intended - media says so too..</p>
<p>bigtech calls the shot in california - take whatever happens there as their "grand genius" plan for the world</p>
<p>eg - driverless cars etc</p>
<p>billion $ means they are good and people to trust....and maybe this really is the "right" thing to do ?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need to share all this - surely ppl of California were too busy to know what they are paying for...</p>
<p>Leader of the world are busy giving "esg/dei" speeches - without knowing what it leads to?</p>
<p>A salary to brainwash someone's kid......permanently.</p>
<p>Works - everyone was just doing their "job" - they dint know what "harm" it might cause!!!</p>
