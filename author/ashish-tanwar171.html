<p>While this change creates new opportunities, few of the much needed improvements in our lives would be</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>less propaganda : the fake $ money which pumped the "news" - the celebs. the saviors etc, cannot just ride on ESG related mandates - enforced by WEF via BlackRock, Vanguard etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>innovation : the fake $ and its "investment" arms - the holier than thou Thiels, investment ponies like nappster SA etc cant just acquire tech to bury it under pits of western capitalism which rules by eco subservience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fall of alfreds : blah blah managerial bakwaas loses value in a flintstones' world - west is fast on its way.</p>

<p>"leaders", googlers and "role-models" - for weak willed, unskilled, greedy - future newbie alfreds.</p>
<p>The essential part of last 18 months was - i did not want to deal with these ppl </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>degrades my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fighting with pigs in mud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for money, fame - 2 of the most limiting things when u want to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a general assault on physical senses of sight, hearing and 'logic'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;lose time and energy - genius level tail wagging comps.</p>
<p>the "brand" is mud now. Google will be going downhill from now on - eu/brics ...u ll see.</p>
<p>I ll do my part - the mail has all the names, verbal lying recordings and a lot of "other stuff" </p>
<ul>
<li>so lets be done with "genius booglers" - light that fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not new - the out of warranty oldies and their ego massaging alfreds have crossed my path, only to find out the significance of "Tanwar" ðŸ™‚ </p>
<p>The game could have been over the day i resorted to lowest layers of existence - nihilism - i came from it. </p>
<p>Subtle things which you realize when u have outplayed it - the game is as good as the opponent - a defeat is a win if the opponent has skills which you admire - helps you imbibe them.</p>
<p>A game with fake leaders and their psychological/virtual/real offsprings has no win for me.</p>
<p>I took time to debug myself - last 20 years changed something in my psych, the silence which was there when i needed it, was not there.</p>
<p>I couldn't enjoy coding - my initial "feeling" when i chose CS as career.</p>
<p>The answer was much deeper and it took time.</p>
<p>Money perverted my motivations in ways that it was too subtle to debug.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to pinpoint the reason - the tools, the ide, the os, or the hardware or me.</p>
<p>It took some time, and now we are back. </p>
<p>Lets play our own game now, shall we?</p>
<p>A win has a proud feeling to it - it feels pure, earned, innovative in some sense.</p>
<p>Codeparity "Paw" - u ll hear about it....maybe in next 6 months.</p>
<p>Money - is a tricky force - it can switch sides in most weird ways.</p>
<p>Thanks and TC.</p>

<p>if i "knock one out of the park"....which i am known to do "now and then".... it solves for itself ðŸ˜€ </p>
<p>Kind of doing an innovation++ here, a new product, with new "non woke" mannerisms, innovation in baldie teaching.....just too much...</p>
<p>becoming a side note in someone's "win" is really a good future...a joker would have liked a better origin story though....i liked being lazy way too much

<p>I know the why and how, it is as logical as belief, if one "zooms" out correctly</p>
<p>a "gestalt" like the nice person "describes" it</p>
<p>a must watch  <span class="videobox">

<p>like everyone, my "gestalt" seems to be tuned.</p>
<p>it is not magic.</p>
<p>it doesnt require any guru-ness</p>
<p>it doesnt even require you to ack me or my stray existence....</p>
<p>just follow the prophet...question it...its motives, logic...everything</p>
<p>and then you will know.</p>
<p>How to get there - its is all pure science and logic - links are all in there in my posts....but it starts with a belief...an investment in "you", not in anyone else or any gyaani.</p>

<p>Precision</p>
<p>-bardie clearly is designed for ambiguity</p>
<p>-alfreds have succeeded in making computers - imprecise</p>
<p>that is quite a 100x, moonshot, x kinda achievement!!</p>
<p>Efficiency</p>
<p>TPS - Tokens per seconds seems to be the defining characteristic of "practicality" of any ai model</p>
<p>bardie seems to be happy spouting off boilerplate, master pleasing stuff - clearly running more cycles than required </p>
<p>(GPUs are known to help in sustainability - atleast "knowledge/search/ai" would say so)</p>
<p>Relationship</p>
<p>it seems like a very public one. Bard is the personal errands alfred.</p>
<p>Seems like an "objective" - bard/google establish "truth" by pushing ad/free "news" as "service" to their "users"</p>
<p>a mass product - a common sync between the rich and normal sheep.</p>
<p>Rich ones can afford Siri anyways.</p>
<p>Alexa runs the house...</p>
<p>They put so much thought into it.. all pseudo psych characters required by an isolated individual =&gt; divided society, provided by capitalistic bots with equal or competing share of a users psych.</p>
<p>That is quite an example of "do no evil".</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Stars are shining, stocks are up - world is singing to your tune</p>
<p>Rejoice, for humanity has birthed its tech "savior"</p>
<p>....this was few years back</p>
<p>then, it became about freedom and claiming it back</p>
<p>....dems/libs are out of control - he says</p>
<p>It is harvest time now, so forget all that</p>
<p>...now attach your biometrics to get a 160 character, "free" voice - so fair!!</p>
<p>summarizing the context:</p>
<p>twitter was about communication - it served a purpose of worldwide "broadcast"</p>
<p>conspiracy ppl call it propoganda - "virality"/"the sob stories", "the proud moments", etc-  ( recommendations blah blah algos which every "big tech" engg crams up, only to never use ðŸ˜Ž ) </p>
<ul>
<li>talk to a real engg, and he will tell you how financially "insane" a M+ fanout global model looks like - it was never financially viable - based on "fanout" alone</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;It served a global purpose of global sync of ppl. </p>
<p>eg farmer agitations in India getting morality lectures from PMs who cancelled bank accounts of their "dissenting" citizens</p>
<p>Now money is not money- but a token.</p>
<p>a token which may allow you to tweet, communicate with "rightly suggested" people (based on location, occupation, pay - sheep stable etc)</p>
<p>X is about global money, it makes sense too</p>
<p>=ai to "generate content", neuralink to "conjure" the content on fly..., tesla to take you around (till its "safe")...and X to do "everything"</p>
<p>WEF likey global money, global society, no religion, no diversity.</p>
<p>-just diversity in the "kind" of people, </p>
<p>NOT</p>
<p>in what they consume.</p>
<p>or read</p>
<p>or believe</p>
<p>or eat</p>
<p>or think</p>
<ul>
<li>just few saviors, who were there in time, to do the right things, when "people" needed them</li>
</ul>
<p>What option do we have - worldcoin seems evil, so go with muskie!!!</p>
<p>A pattern -  like last 100 years of west - create 2 divides, both do the same, but speak in different dialects.</p>
<p>Overplayed? No, i think there is still a lot of "trust" left....</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Religious ppl have a specific name in the Bible - the deceiver, false light prophet etc...</p>
<p>but we are logic ppl .... we play by "science"</p>
<p>when muskie dresses up as baphomet, as "a joke" .... it is still "science"?? or "cool"</p>
<p>there seem to be a sacred law - they never lie, only deceive/divert</p>
<p>I am just stumped by how accurate some of the depictions are .... and how eroded the faith of a normal human is - in any of the religions - convenient to knit-pick without adhering to the values any of them prescribes.

<blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin has a rival </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>this one bundles free sat "internet" ???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or few "unfiltered tweets"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or few "extra driving hours"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Muskie wins this one - the one who can do no wrong!!</p>
