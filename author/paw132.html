<p>Avg tenure</p>
<p>Eco cycle - $$ recession</p>
<p>Strength of baldies - using others politeness, manners to their advantage</p>
<p>And my personal goals - body, mind</p>
<p>I went into G thinking that wars are over - finally some pure 'creation' time - the so called 'gCulture' of 20% projects, nice ppl and all that 'publicity' stuff</p>
<p>Then you get to meet the baldies which are not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>No startup exp</p>
<p>All lalas of different cultures trying to become Alfred[] at 50+</p>
<p>Doing all muskie, billy and other stereotype bakwaas - when they are on a 'job'</p>
<p>Technically, there should be no 'friction', a win of an engineer works out better for the manager...</p>
<p>reality, is v v different - it seems a sort of subservience - an engineer cannot 'innovate', the 'leader' (the wannabe, neverbeen, not an engineer, absolute weight on earth) should 'innovate'</p>
<p>This is quite simple to understand, if you really dissect the word - manager.</p>
<p>What does a manager manage?</p>
<p>Talented/skilled people</p>
<p>he guides them, synchronized them </p>
<p>=&gt; times the individual output to the final assembly.</p>
<p>Yet, a typical manager - does nothing of that kind</p>
<p>-created work to create his 'identity'</p>
<p>-has to bully his team, if there is nothing he can do</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This used to be called 'brokering' when the work doesnt involve humans.</p>
<p>When it involves humans, it becomes something outrageous, unacceptable.</p>
<p>Yet, it is the 'desired' position.</p>

                <p>Kiran Bajwa - an origin story</p>
<p>Kiran was born in a wealthy family.</p>
<p>Ignored, not really blessed with conventional beauty, Kiran had a penchant for 'games'.</p>
<p>Fame and Game - the 2 strengths of Kiran.</p>
<p>Knowing full aware of his strengths and weaknesses, Kiran tried hard in life to get everything with makes her notice to the larger, conventionally good looking ppl - a lot of insecurity of growing up in a good family with all means.</p>
<p>Kiran is a warrior - she just know what she deserves and what stands in her way.</p>
<p>In 20s, Kiran went all in - nihilistic way.</p>
<p>Flattery, Greed - 2 of the biggest hacks Kiran identified in his 'journey' of fame, glam and 'page 3 success'</p>
<p>Computers/Tech seemed to be most quickfire way to achieve this - prove it to the larger habitus of ppl - the spouse and kids - all amazed at Kiran succeeding with these 2 hacks - lust of different kinds.</p>
<p>Decades went on, Kiran perfected the tools out of 'fear'  - used his bulging stomach and hunger with western suits and language, to his advantage.</p>
<p>She realized the age and its 'projection. </p>
<p>Young-ins looked up to her - his ways were interpreted as ways of a Sensei - the one who knows how to get the job done.</p>
<p>She realized and created a following of loyal followers - his all professional experience boils down to following algo</p>
<p>How do i look - (to others) : Perception</p>
<p>How to build it : add more gurls and guys </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the nerdy cheerleaders of IT sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make an example of the guy who stands out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the cheerleaders to weed out the opposition - no harm, no fowl - they did it all within themselves</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;&gt; sensei lesson within cheeleaders, the ones who take the lead and accomplish the 'task' </p>
<ul>
<li>Kiran's chosen ones - the passi</li>
</ul>
<p>Great algo.</p>
<p>worked for all pros - 1bm, hc1, 0rak1e etc - decades went and the hard taskmaster 'sensei kiran' became popular.</p>
<p>All was working - but Kiran wanted more..</p>
<p>Kiran was successful - just not the kind she imagined.</p>
<p>Kiran loved 'Mike''s role in GodFather </p>
<ul>
<li>a movie she barely understood, yet liked.</li>
</ul>
<p>This limited understanding of life - movies, professional/personal life - was working out for him - The force seems to be with her with the 'ambition' of appearing on a page 3 still unachieved.</p>
<p>This domestic/natural adulation - did not seem to matter to kiran - she wanted a life, a legend - everything like Babar of Ghazanvi</p>
<ul>
<li>cont.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Missed an important detail - despite being in tech, kiran kept her faith in a sort of 'god' - the underworld - called hockus pockus, or occult in her native household - she doesnt know anything, yet tried everything, assumes some 'spiritual knowledge'</p>
<p>....she dealth with baphomet - her allegiance and needs - all align with solve et coagula. - lust and losss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we will put in plugs for the 'horror' genre - just provides a bigger metaverse </p>
<ul>
<li>though kiran keeps it klassy - tarot and weird mantras and all - easy money - easy targets.</li>
</ul>

                <p>an open challenge to kiran baweja</p>
<p>i wont hide behind people and screens.</p>
<p>lets make it an open challenge - if anyone in your ancestory ever had 00s</p>
<ul>
<li>i am game.</li>
</ul>
<p>i will play</p>
<p>and there is no one in G or in your G - that will do anything about it.</p>
<p>edit : updated the spells - it is "Kiran" not Karan - just your english speaking, yet typical muhulle ki auntie.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5 Years - to put your name to shame, $$ and everything - just wag that tail to goras and see me do it....and all that "gasligting" by those g-class peeps - showing them.</p>
<p>hard part is done...now just "exe"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>toughness - a leader should be 'tougher' than a 'stray'...</p>
<p>prove it - entire tree of bawejas</p>
<p>u r not the 'target' - just an example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ignore - pimp more employees - try more of leadership tactics</p>
<p>this would be public now - gloves off.</p>
