<p>The 'key' of 'timing' the 'stack' pop is  about 'time'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they should be along the path</p>

<p>not become the path</p>

<li>
<p>time, if you hack yours - a 0 in true logic $$ terms, 1 can buy real years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>years/months - all to traverse along the path - traveler's algo, just a real, scalable 1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>simple strategies look like 'magic' when 1 knows his 0s.</p>

                <p>Angels/Demons and their 3d ways </p>
<ul>
<li>absolutely delusional abdul like take.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Hinduism - you can be born a 'Dev'(god being) or 'Daitya'(devil being)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is 1 or the other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pundits may do their numerical magic - defy the % in which the balance of 3d universe lies - both are needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>balance</p>
<p>Good/Bad</p>
<p>i really dont know absolute good or bad.</p>
<p>people try, then  hindsight makes people and prophets look 'genius'</p>
<p>I am trying to understand this boundary of good|bad</p>
<p>In nihilism - it is meaningless - just a body's desires as decided by reality and lure of 'feelings' based half of brain - akin to $$++</p>
<p>In medieval times - material might - abduls rules</p>
<p>in 'modern' times - logical might - alfreds rule.</p>
<p>No one can define 'progress' </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>rightfully claim 'good' </p>
<p>unless they cite the holy book or religion </p>
<ul>
<li>the wrongs done by some neanderthal as written by another neanderthal - all near to monkey intellect - $ science tells us that.</li>
</ul>
<p>holy books are not just religion - they are the rule books</p>
<p>name changes, intent doesnt</p>
<p>-religion in medieval times</p>
<p>-science in 'industrialized times'</p>
<p>-'education' in current 'peak' times</p>
<p>all that blah blah - to pose some Q's</p>
<p>who can define good and bad?</p>
<p>leaders know?</p>
<p>preachers/influencers/karma deciders - do they know?</p>
<p>i dont think anyone knows anything - the maya or matrix is 1s understanding and relevance in matrix</p>
<p>just like the hypothetical 'devil/shaitaan/daitya' manifests itself via its hacks - lust, gluttony etc</p>
<p>God, would manifest itself in similar ways - the hacks - temptation to devil.</p>
<p>As above - so below.</p>
<p>all this is known, yet forgotten - newton, karma, nature : it is a universal fact -  each religion agrees.</p>
<ul>
<li>devil and his hacks seem to have executed a DDOS via glam, shimmer, success....</li>
</ul>
