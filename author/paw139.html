                <p>if u have the unfortunate experience of getting hooked into a 'nerdy/ratty' version of online big boss...</p>
<p>my apologies.</p>
<p>i started writing a series of emails to my son. something he can have access to when he is 18+</p>
<p>The 'loss' of a fatherfigure - akin to base layer of emotional and material experience - exposes u - the 0s.</p>
<p>I had to work through my life - 'reverse engineering' most social constructs after my  loss</p>
<p>in 2003 - the year i dint know if i earned that 'degree' </p>
<ul>
<li>most habitus of engineering/familia - verdict was given </li>
</ul>
<p>0--</p>
<p>this can happen to anyone - a real possibility, considering me, my ways, values and 'bent' limits...</p>
<p>hence the emails.</p>
<p>started writing those emails - became googler after another 0</p>
<ul>
<li>it meant dealing with 'genius' - the time and energy vampires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i realized the truth which every father realized later - the pattern...how out of time all this would sound - the world and its 'truth' - is only relative to religion, $ and 'intents' of masters and alfreds with abduls on standby...</p>
<p>Sounding 'delusional' was a real concern - a typical 'age-gap' thing.</p>
<p>debugging this 'pattern' - makes you really spiral...what should i really 'tell, time, words' - context...</p>
<p>thats how a stray...ventured into history, religion and all...</p>
<p>i dint go into gory details of nepotism - who did what and when - just the 'impact' it had - capitalism, psy/op on society -&gt; habits -&gt; morality -&gt; trends -&gt;  $$++</p>
<p>it is really not that 'genius'.</p>
<p>the debug - critical thinking</p>
<p>=&gt; 'delusional' - if only 1 does it</p>
<p>==&gt; 'failure' - if 1 persists with it üòÇ - its an addiction - tinfoil ppl and all </p>
<p>the patch</p>
<p>=&gt; debug 'intents'</p>
<p>==&gt; critical thinking - life is programmed for it - survival and all</p>
<p>rest - every 0 has 1s which are not brick++</p>
<p>jobs - they are $ balance - your 8 hours of 'low', to have 8 hours of 'life'</p>
<p>everything else - alfred baazi</p>
<p>Hope u learnt - i sure hope my son does, and he is not alone - if 'critical thinking' is really alive.</p>
<p>ppl can just say nay - to neuralink and larger pale lizard brit unkle's pediatric designs</p>
<p>G is an example - i hope this blahBlah - made u learn something.</p>
<p>hack - is the serpant - ppl 'fear' it, for me - another lifeform</p>
<p>respect in parity.</p>

<p>i was a real 'bully' in some aspects - i 'liked' it, even had a 'gang' of bullies...</p>
<p>it was still based in 'merit' - of ability - being streetwise and able</p>
<p>gave it up to follow alfred path...the alfred path which seems to make a bully = leader</p>
<p>it is not that black and white...experience teaches u that...</p>
<p>having the 'right' relative reasons makes intent++, no resistance in body/mind -&gt; hence intents</p>
<p>dexter to 50+ baldies is not something to 'like'...</p>
<p>the insight is really in mindset of a bully - how few seconds or words of assumed inflated ego perceived 'disrespect'....multiply and double up like an addicted gambler algo....</p>
<p>i know me - used that 'knowledge' to tame the experienced gBullies - now maybe xooglers,  many in making.</p>
<p>all avoidable, if bullies really knew - now it is indelible, unforgettable, unrepeatable - their peak is now their worst memory </p>
<p>very Shakespearean - brit masters would be proud

<p>choices - forced on me...</p>
<p>ridiculed, timed - the baldies did their 'best' as per their intellect - call cia, Private investigators, everything possible via g$$ and genius perception of 100x poodles.</p>

<p>recap - what a brand is </p>

<li>it is value and perception</li>

<p>baldies borrowed it - build their future on it - as a base layer</p>
<p>'googlers' - the word ppl would get engraved on their tomb stones - if society allowed it üòÄ </p>
<p>what paw did here is simple - challenged the brand and perception of 'having the best'</p>
<p>they dont have the 'best' - cant keep it</p>
<p>brand--, company-- = perception = $ value</p>
<p>no products in line - just more 'promises' of success.</p>
<p>value was created - it was taken from the brand and its admirers</p>
<p>value, which should follow 'newtons' law of emotions'

                <p>I am not "throwing 90s grads" term out of any "feelings", it is quite logical</p>
<p>graduated in 90s</p>
<p>=&gt; 20++ years of experiance</p>
<p>-leaders = highest order alfreds - telco, internet, apps - many 1s with 0s $$ and followers</p>
<p>-top management, middle management - all form habitus of 'cutting edge' tech, college, politics and even the pool of 'leadership'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>had access to tech : comp education was available to all of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had 1st hand access to 0s and 1s - knowledge and opportunity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they knew, but were/are too comfortable to 'use' that knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>algos - all very visible in social strata - yet no 'guru' would identify them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mugging algos - just like brit masters intended to 'implement'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not learning algos - just like masters intended to 'imply'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fails on dharma</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fails on definition of progress - any dictionary</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so whats left??</p>
<p>just 'need of gratitude' and page 3 level bakwaas </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>some sweat shop inventor of inforsys - has been, telling next gens() to continue to majdoori/labor : it is the way of soros funded sensei.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some sorry yet, culturally potite gyaan - which no wannabe alfred should question - culture, respect and ll</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; we dint do anything 'worthwhile', yet we are the 'daddies'</p>
<p>no baldies</p>
<p>the sun, the earth </p>
<ul>
<li>they make everything possible, we just really 'channel' it to our 'ways'</li>
</ul>
<p>no gratitude</p>
<p>no respect</p>
<p>no disrespect</p>
<p>yet a balance of 'execution', a format is necessary - 2024.</p>
<p>masters are doing it anyways - no alfred knows when poodles are abandoned, he just thinks it wont be he/she/it/her/whatever.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i call sitting on desk as modern slavery/majdoori - forgetting the use of limbs - senses and their ability to diff psy ops - medical, work - $$, fame etc....</p>
<p>so really if your $$ may even rise, but would it be $++ with age++ as mental/medical-- and % of alfreds++?</p>
<p>yet i am the delusional 1..</p>
<p>$$ really establishes 'truth' etc++ - so thats the next 'game'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am all about real life examples, so taking a g_baldie_1 : check his progression, college, habitus, employment, title, words - every matrix dimension -</p>
<p>now consider his fate : denying 0s</p>
<p>we call it a 'rage quit' </p>
<p>what makes it memorable is, ironically the 'rockstar age' itself üòÇ </p>
<p>poignant leader : the limit</p>
<p>the words : limit</p>
<p>ability/googleyness : limit</p>
<p>age/experience : hacked till infinity</p>
<p>even Guide/Rajesh Khanna path is blocked - damm this global internet üòò </p>
<p>cant do a pathaan - k.k.k....kiran needs some muskle and movement</p>
<p>kya khoya?</p>
<p>Kya paaya?</p>
<p>all g_baldies[] really..</p>

<p>music recommendation to baldies - now, now++ etc...</p>
<p>it is the emotion - the feeling - the stack[now], and ensuring now++ is aligned withing intent vectors of 0s/1s...</p>
