                <p>Ego and "Pre-Empteening" Baldie attacks. - Defense &amp;&amp; Offense</p>
<p>What i am story-telling here - is a v v 'nice' abstraction of the 'niceness' of baldies.</p>
<p>g_baldies[] were/are not the first baldies to cross my path, steal ip/ideas, eating salary etc...</p>
<p>One of the most deceptive desi lizard is literally named after Street Fighter baddie - Bison</p>
<p>In real life - S Bison....</p>
<p>the 'entrepreneur' 'visionary' - who literally destroyed and continue to mislead all newbie telecom engineers - with perception - for decades now.</p>
<p>The reason i am using this perceived 'low blow' tactic - of online de-masking is for something which i perceive greater good - next gen should do better than this nobody, nevebeen, glorified broker.</p>
<p>Oh - he is going to get real sued for real code stealing - it was just me prioritizing human targets to hack - in a very delhi-joker way.</p>
<p>In Codeparity - we call it 'debug' - knowing the 'problem'</p>
<p>The reason, which elevated this nobody, neverbeen, hasbeen, wannabe 5 foot of glory - hakla english, nepotistic traits - to my focus is simple - karma is due.</p>
<p>so bisen - i r next, dont do the baldie trick of 'age forgivenes' - a hindu would have retired or apologized or just do 'chully bhar paani....'</p>
<p>The larger reason - concept of forgiveness - what it really means, and how society - erswhile nobody baldies - denying retirement for blue_pills++, hot_hr++, car++ while(){ cout&lt;&lt;"Oh economy is bad";} </p>
<p>scales - balance with % - we "digital telesoftware engineers" - one of the best bunch of hungry engineers - all brokered by few 'baldies, telecom geniuses' - to the real slavery we were sold off to a lala of great repute - including PF - left lalu behind.</p>
<p>M bison is taller, doesnt have napoleon complex - he is a villain, but a good one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this 'genius' went out of way to publish my 'salary' to future employees - costing me the telecom cockroach jar....</p>
<p>now i see the jar and king cockroaches...</p>
<p>good i left that regressing habitus - it has it gods - unfallable - time immaterial, local afreds -&gt; gods of tech</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the g_baldies or baldies in general - rule by a 'perception' - i call them telco gangs</p>
<p>hss, ariscent etc - all 'leadership' geniuses - progress is counted as how to 'extract' more data for money - the learn from G</p>
<p>the old baldies, now g_baldies[] - they share this habitus - of rub my back, ill rub urs - the saddest page 3 imho - real baldies with 'treatments' - posing for the ever in making - telco startup success $$</p>
<p>dint happen for any of them - 20 years + ðŸ˜‚  </p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>u meet lots of self perceived logic gods in desi telecom circle - one was on - oh gluten is bad - went on rants on how rice is good</p>
<p>selective logic - apni halat dekho, phir gyaan do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>glassdor etc - broker 'reviews' - any entrepreneur knows that...</p>
<p>high time next gen starts calling out 'decades old gods' - they are viscious in this jar, just nice in 'office;</p>

                <p>Mathematical induction and Religion</p>
<p>Every religion has a central figure - a God alias : the deemed 'God'</p>
<p>If i give example of any other 'religion' - blasphemy risks - abdul or alfred might get triggered..</p>
<p>so i ll use mine - Hinduism and its nepotistic 'tool' - perceived deemed 'God' - Manu</p>
<p>Manu = 1</p>
<p>where is 0?</p>
<p>We need 0s - mathematically/logically or even materially. Where is 'egg'???</p>
<p>It fails for n=0</p>
<p>n=1</p>
<p>yet it scales for N, N+1...to infinity ( or need for control - political, ideological and material )</p>
<p>Political control - what happens now.</p>
<p>Ideological/Religious control - the abstract intent (vector of society)</p>
<p>Material - the enforcement arms - judges, police, leaders.</p>
<p>Who wrote 'ManuSmriti'?</p>
<p>Manu?</p>
<p>Was he all read and able without 0?</p>
<p>how did he break the 'fibonacchi sequence'?</p>
<p>hermaphrodite?</p>
<p>Or just a feminine hating narcissist? </p>
<p>or just like abdul or alfred?</p>
<p>Texts written by man - interpreted by a man, when 'reading' was 'restricted'.</p>
<p>My intent.</p>
<p>My runtime has always been memory/cpu constraints by these java programs - they think memory management doesn't exist, coz lower order $ capitalism programs like me/us/0s - do it for them.</p>
<p>There is much to dissect - but lets enjoy the gFireworks - what happens when java mindset rises and 'wins'.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>manu is just a variable in this iteration of 'matrix'</p>
<p>even abdul/afreds run the same algos - just that the wave of $$ changes - the grand illusion of 'change - blue is bad, red is good' - reps - dems, abdul - alfred, etc...</p>
<p>not so different - just different languages and 'timing'</p>
<p>internet - global connectivity = 21st century - tower of babel</p>
<p>the ppl who run this tower - the boogles, the zamazons, whatever, oil, shinzinpin etc... they know this.</p>
<p>they just want their version of nihilistic 'vision' over yours - sheep of different religions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the leaders, self proclaimed 'mentors'....mine are definitely not without 'self bias', some have appropriated words, intents, ambitions, ideas .... just like an any alfred..</p>
<p>it doesnt work - the religion is complete and independent - its parts dont compute in isolation - so being a hindu and copying this. = doesnt work.</p>
<p>intents = joker here - wont help anyone become $$...</p>
<p>it is gnu - gpl of 'intents'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh there are new 'prophets' or hackers of 'hinduism' ..in order of 'impact'</p>
<p>home minister and progeny</p>
<p>the newly bhagwa businessmen and hindu alfreds</p>
<p>the renaissance 'social media cool peeps' - the rs 500 book writers/ new = Intellect(type HINDU)...</p>
<p>proud ++ </p>
<p>all forgetting the very logical question - if it was so great and all - why did it fall?</p>
<p>then they resort to 'sanatan' coz casteism comes in when 'manusmriti' comes up...</p>
<p>then - the base layer of written text - the vedas</p>
<p>appropriated as 'hindu', now alias 'sanatan' - to get the max vote of sikhism jainism etc...</p>
<p>something 'perfect' works - it is resilient - just like distributed systems eg = earth - the food, the life</p>
<p>sun = time immortal</p>
<ul>
<li>the roots of my 'hindusim' - popular 'Hinduism'</li>
</ul>
<p>so 'CodeParity' = no perceived intellectual inferiority/superiority</p>
<p>it is 10x approach = it works in business - a reboot, no sequels. ðŸ˜€ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote some blah about using 'tech' to establish 'parity' - codeparity...</p>
<p>working thorough the 'wheel of emotions' - yours : to tap into 'emotions' - traversing through it - using logic/work.....</p>
<p>i did mention - emotions are result of a 'transaction' - $ is just a symbol - the material part - emotion equation works like maths or %</p>
<p>time -&gt; interest &amp;&amp; 'karma' - the abstract invisible real abstract 'score' ....</p>
<p>the g_baldies[] are learning this ...december is a month of celebration - equinox</p>
<p>though - somewhere the light is dimming....0 sum games..often end like this ... oldies + ego = 'genius egoistical mammoth cockroach jar with king cockroach taking a v v public and 0 fall' - with no 'alternatives'..</p>
<p>should ve been more intelligent...maybe even more years ...like 10,20+ years...</p>
<p>naah - wont have mattered...the higher they r. the louder they fall</p>

<p>i dont want to glorify the 'genius' of g_class of 'intellect' and 'title' achievers more...this is 1 thing i need to remove from my stack...so this is the end of g_baldie_1 and associated clique - it is more than 'symbolic' - karma and all...</p>
<p>it would be hindsight soon, and exercising the luxury of hindsight...</p>
<p>old ppl have a moral and biological responsibility to define 'progress'</p>

<li>ban it under ageism or whatever : merit or $ capitalism simply has no room for 'emotions' in a 'cos' wave of $ capitalism</li>

<p>nepotism got them there, so winds blow in laid down path - the already traveled 1 - laid down by an alfred</p>
<p>the "strategy" as a general CS engineer</p>
<p>find the common 'class' - the intersections which make non merit base ppl 'click'</p>
<p>here - age, habitus, mediocrity based origins - self build and persisted cockroach jar</p>

<p>huddles and all - all cheap pvt whatsap etc</p>

<p>the limits of these 'wannabe= new Googlers()'</p>

                <p>The CodeParity new year 'horror' story.</p>
<p>Horror and happiness go hand in hand. Nothing exemplifies this than 'December' </p>
<p>new year</p>
<p>-end of another cycle of '$ worship'</p>
<p>-a society approved appropriately 'time' the psy/op of 'things to get/do' in next cycle</p>
<p>gym, parks, hobbies - they just become unbearable with $ dependent people in january</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>intending to do the 'best'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pattern of years already diminishes the </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>'hope $$ will' is already on ego's balance</p>
<p>=&gt;a battle,  started in mind, before the 'war'</p>
<p>//statistically, people loose this quest every 'year'</p>
<p>they dont know their 0.</p>
<p>really.</p>
<p>in all honesty.</p>
<p>It is about 'perspective'</p>
<p>Knowing yourself </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>know thyself </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I/1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing your 1s, knows what counts as </p>
<p>-'progress'</p>
<p>-'happiness'</p>
<p>-'growth'</p>
<p>-'laxmi, saraswati, kali' - all forms of feminine/creative/rewarding forces 'help' you - the 'mother' - the Earth.</p>
<p>No, it is not a 'vehicle' to make 'name' for 'thyself'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i am not really 'fond' of ppl</p>

<p>not in corp circus</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thing about doing something this 'ridiculous' is simple - a religion which already decides what u can and would do - as decided by 'pundits' in my religion...</p>
<p>i ve given a royal salute to all of them - already...</p>
<p>a father really succeds when his son 'likes' the foundation - he should be able to 'build' on it.</p>
<p>i am not about leaving fake inheritance, if few baldies are in way - their problem - mug more books..... i am more about we are born 'able', made dependent by 'genius'</p>

<blockquote>
<p>paw - born Indian/Hindu - my vocab is about Hindu Goddesses/Devis- all very well represented, yet misunderstood by the slow of mind - the muggers - the historians, the 'scholars,'the nepotists (called caste-ism) in India</p>
<p>same pattern - different names. </p>
<p>Paw is an object of CodeParity, it has the 'choice' of choosing his 'words' and skills.</p>
<p>it is not a bondage of $ time bound $$ dependent 'festivals' - just asking some Qs to urself - and your 'God' answers. </p>
<p>Mine is 'rationality' - Thoth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a celebration?</p>
<p>alfreds culling turkeys - yet telling the world that climate is bad, eat zee bugs and all</p>
<p>abduls - feeling the 'time' of revelation, the 'time' of abdul unleashed is here now!!</p>
<p>if  you = new CodeParity(), it has abstract functions of 'year' - you define it, not let tv, news and religion define it...</p>
<p>typeid(CodeParity)  has freedom to 'time' it - do it when it 'rhymes' - $$ is less, and less noise.</p>
