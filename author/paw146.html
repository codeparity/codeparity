                <p>Delusions, beliefs and perception = truth</p>
<p>this is a personal discovery - walking and hacking the fine lines...</p>
<p>the most prevalent and genius iq hack for ppl is to paint their 'targets' as - hackable or hacked = capability / intellect / intents</p>
<p>the ultimate hack = delusional</p>
<p>the times we live in, logical arguments and even words, seem to 'hurt'</p>
<p>so feelings - are often prioritized</p>
<p>matrix - the 4th one....the lizards did make this point - they shifted a binary matrix to 'feelings' based - grey 1 - everyone thinks 'guilt' yet capitalism/time must flow...</p>
<p>greys - everywhere, though lizards would have their ways anyway...</p>
<p>booglie/personal recap of side effects of 0</p>
<p>ppl show themselves - they put in their final verdict...</p>
<p>for me, it was 'delusional/disturbed'</p>
<p>it flew...</p>
<p>i was 0...so i dint know....i felt...but debugging is about being sure.</p>
<p>0 became 0--, as ppl-=ppl loop continued...</p>
<p>0...has a weird power...to see from a 0....the opportunities...appear.</p>
<p>they are different from your perception of being N</p>
<p>=&gt;logically, one becomes 0 from N...so definitely perception/opportunities are different.</p>
<p>they change as 'intents' show themselves...</p>
<p>thats the real investment of time, life....</p>
<p>ideas, viability on / of ppl...will keep on evolving...</p>
<p>the key is patience/time - life of 0</p>
<p>faith/belief/religion - whatever 1's true 0 is ...remains with them</p>
<p>and then ...power of 0</p>
<p>its awesome coz - its u.</p>
<p>it really doesnt matter what 10000 or 1000000 say.</p>
<p>1 is what made them...0s come in plenty ðŸ˜€ </p>

<p>the perception game is just not personal - UN, Muskie, WHO - they all use this 'perception' of being 'good' to do to most 'constructive' work in the world....it is only logical that N meets this choice = aligning to lizard ring of destitution or become 0..</p>
<p>our corp leaders - product of these brands - made by them, know their worth is evaluated by media - hollow/intel inside kind 'leaders' - indian/global -- pappus.</p>

<p>now,</p>
<p>future</p>
<p>and history, science at all - only to establish or unestablish a path - whether it works, or is just a fantasy - history and all - known, observable 1</p>
<p>too abstract - i get it...</p>
<p>it goes like this...</p>
<p>now - if $$ is the issue (it would be - $ is the unsaid religion)</p>
<p>really consider the credit and debit - how they have changed over years - as you got income/age++</p>
<p>the best 0 to compute is bachelor days - the brief period - if any ...when 1 had more $$ than to spend</p>
<p>thats you 'good' 0</p>
<p>then now - the cars, the properties, the emis, or returns - their time value and variance...</p>
<p>the difficult part - the feelings which these 'debts' or assumed 'investments' cause you - things - easy</p>
<p>ppl - v v difficult...</p>
<p>time is the real $$, the money $$ is an illusion - which makes your 0++ - habitus and their 'emotional' expectations</p>
<p>=&gt; your time and its value = the lowest time returns  - yet dependents </p>
<p>some duties, most just emotional debts - the proverbial cockroach jar - which keeps moving in rhythm with "trends" - cool cars, homes, tech - to establish </p>
<p>$$ superiority in order of alfreds.</p>
<p>thats how 1 really knows - what he wants - get skilled++ = ai, tools, tech - all free, all available for anyone..</p>
<p>but then, the real hack is 'looking good', make it till u fake it and all - suckers work, smart ppl earn - the hidden msg in all the stevie jovs, mukerzerx and now - muskie and faultman...</p>
<p>cant fix a tyre - yet 'kings' of their ponds of glory - the title and all..always afraid of not being the psy/op the superman title does to ego - for spouse, kid - etc...not worth it -imho </p>
<p>your 0 - is different from mine</p>
<p>my wants are as unique as my origin story - hence my actions.</p>
<p>a 0 - is knowing this for sure.</p>
<p>$$ money is a tool - can be 'hacked'/borrowed - if u get 'good'</p>
<p>metaverse is really needed for some ppl - wont do well in real 1 ðŸ˜‚ </p>

<p>the reason i say $ is the real religion...is simply that most religions require some clothes, some things - festivals and all to really abide and receive blessings - the psy/op of being an eternal sinner/always owed gratitude and all - morality of it</p>
