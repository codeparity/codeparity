                <p>Hack-ability of consumer electronics - the "techie" stuff</p>
<p>No matter how "open source" you go - the final frontier has always been the "invisible os" or the processor which you dont and cant control</p>
<p>In laptops/computers - it is the bios</p>
<p>In Phones - it is the baseband - the chip which ideally should be just doing the rf-digital-analog modem thing</p>
<p>But it does way, way more</p>
<p>the basic services - sms etc - will always have flaws - the "rf payload" is decoded, executed at these "invisible processors" running a closed source os</p>
<p>There are some partially known ways to interact - some of them are documented, most of them are not. One of the known ways to "hack a baseband" is to know the layers -</p>
<p>qmi </p>
<p>ril</p>
<p>baseband</p>
<p>uknown or reverse engineer-able. </p>
<p>Get a cert, hack a room would only get you this far - it is capitalism using your "hacks" to hack you  - a new brick - a new kind of huuumaaan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>glue-ing batteries to phones - apart from making them "thin" to hold, they also seem to ensure "uninterrupted" power to this baseband /os thingy...</p>
<p>firmware updates and alll...delta... ppl dont patch, vendors have delays or incentives to roll out "updates"...</p>
<p>no matter how "techie" one may go - this is a loop... a pattern which keeps the most basic thing out of focus</p>
<p>who made these devices ugly and so indiscriminate? are these really "smart" ppl??</p>

<p>should be part of base education - helps in discovery of "you"</p>
<p>This is about "hacking" from outside. </p>
<p>What if these ppl were the "insiders"?</p>
<p>will they hire to carry on "white collar crimes" or grey corp/capitalistic espionage ?</p>
<p>I think they do, it explains why they will hire "baldies" with "decades" old experience - the "data" is the gold.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the cloud game - full of out of date baldies - who sold "boxes"</p>
<p>suddenly they are needed at "cloud leadership"</p>
<p>none of these guys can really explain cloud to a newbie engineer - they never used it - only preach it.</p>
<p>the pnb thing - hiring of the orakle leadership - was due to their in-prem deployment. GOI forbade cloud in banking long ago - still "detailed account plans" are needed by baldie alfred</p>
<p>i dont think even he knew- he was busy chasing his "golden" bone out of country which treated his as per his "aukaat"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cloud is a "apps" thing - roi/risk is manageable</p>
<p>the "enterprise" part - someone running those servers at superior bandwith, with less cost (discounts etc)</p>
<p>sometimes the discounts wont even justify the "electric cost"</p>
<p>but, they are offered = "strategically"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I dint learn it on purpose - i was on "receiving" end of it.</p>
<p>Always trying to "reverse engineer" - I dint react as i was expected to....initially i did, but you learn</p>
<p>it becomes increasingly evident - the internal "broadcast messaging" - they things, portfolios, the kind of companies/assets they are after....telecom/banking are the "highest" priority, then the nihilistic layers - water, land, agri, electric - whatever the host govt would "allow" them to do</p>
<p>colorado usa - they destroyed a whole city, a river with countless animals to set up the "cloud farms"</p>
<p>yet, the 'news' is their 'fren' so you ll never hear it</p>
<p>just how "big tech" cares - planted trees, green campus and glory...</p>

<p>/*</p>
<p>blahBlah = a former booger employee, brandished - 'non-performer' aka "not as good"/ "Needs Improvement" etc</p>
<p>blahBlah, being very 'improving' - self beating kinds...took it seriously</p>
<p>worked through the self bias, dark night of soul blah and all</p>
<p>it worked.</p>
<p>so blahBlah went to work - logic and execution</p>
<p>this was 2 years back</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>blahBlah was a bully too - in another life, before "duties" took over</p>
<ul>
<li>wolf...of kinds...</li>
</ul>
<p>*/</p>
<p>Now Blah Blah does "Blah Blah" - only pointing out "inconsistencies" in the way of "masters"</p>
<p>well - the master kind of took "an initiative" to brandish blahBlah as "non complaint sheep"</p>
<p>They were right, just that blahBlah wasnt sheep to begin with.</p>
<p>Time - the only thing which eluded blahBlah, due to the circus of "genius ppl" who were "duties" at that time, place.</p>
<p>Time is a wonderful thing. </p>
<p>The very thing which defines "life".</p>
<p>Yet, every pup born or unborn - has his "time" precalculated for him - education, competition - jobs, spouse, cars, sheep++</p>
<p>Time allows you to discern, take a step back .... just to get a perspective of why blahBlah started playing this "circus" without even knowing it....</p>
<p>Science - seems stalled since WW2</p>
<p>Computers - should have "accelerated" innovation</p>
<p>Genome decode - should have atleast cured "headaches" or pimples</p>
<ul>
<li>it just doesnt make sense - inventing ai to replace "us", when "us" is no where near perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>all that blahBlah, is just snake talk...</p>
<p>we talk about baldie vengence... it is real.</p>
<p>so baldie hcI 0rackle fame never understood "brand"</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it tells a lot about ppl - being "indian" is a brand too - do they use it, or give it back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a 70 iq genius baldie, way past his expiry date - due to his attitude, is bound to overestimate his "genius" - no sense of "value", just money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so he assimiliated his hcI bretren - to echo the version of "genius" they ran</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it becomes "truth or GValues"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gThanks amongst this new "bretren" of genius -defines a new culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is barking at cows at his point - the older ones mooed -while hyenas took over - there was no hope.</p>
<p>the surrender of values.</p>
<p>a lot of words were said.</p>
<p>One kind of triggered blahBlah - 'aukat'</p>
<p>It is a very crude way of asking someone of his "worth".</p>
<p>No matter how much blahBlah hated it, this word has hounded him forever - since long.</p>
<p>There was the real enemy.</p>
<p>Now cut to 2023, the high of baldies is over.</p>
<p>The "brand" pimping done by the erstwhile respectable baldies is being "unpeeled" at various layers - something genius level nepotistic iq baldies never realized</p>
<p>What to do?? Spanking is coming from the alfred above??</p>
<p>Hire a third party.</p>
<p>Find the "hacks" in blahBlah - welcome to try.</p>
<p>Just a 'namaste' to "brand management"</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the joker.</li>

                <p>Unkle Billy "reformed" Kenya in 2011</p>
<p>"Friday, February 11, 2011, 12:00 Kenya to mark global roll-out of pneumococcal vaccine against world’s leading cause of child death"</p>

<p>Unkle is proud!!</p>

<p>After ~12 years, kids grow up, and well - an "unknown disease"</p>
<p>Coincidence</p>
<p>or a barely qualified engineer playing doctor, researcher ie new age god?</p>
<p>Why would someone do this "deliberately"?</p>
<p>truth seems stranger than fiction - specially when "education" is "indoctrination"</p>
<p>Time seems to rhyme with the theme of last few years - chaos - all "god made" - climate change is real.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>about $</p>
<p>most fin prophets in west are not really getting it - they think brics will announce some "global currency"...</p>
<p>they really need to revisit history - barter - between countries.</p>
<p>it makes sense for all these - they produce and consume - food, fuel, metals etc</p>
<p>so it is really an exchange - there maybe a currency, but the "concept" is barter not baselining and then trading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evolution - as taught in science, means an organism is "programmed" to evolve to its environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccination - is "needed" for "everything" when the human body has survived thousands of years - some tribes still are "unvaccinated"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These statements can be true in a marvel movie, but not in "science" or rather - logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power of Money - appoint an Indian Alfred to run the "enterprise"</p>
<p>The very real cost of failure wont let him give up, the "indian" thing is in vogue - hardwork of ancestors - "utilized" by unkle billy!</p>
<p>Alfred frees up unkle billy's bandwidth to do "good" around the world</p>
<p>Fake $, fake meds, fake gods and real consequences on the "sheep"</p>
<p>dont feel bad coz it happened in Africa - a poor country...happened in India, now happening in their own "xountries"</p>
<p>masters are really fair - they dont really discriminate - now that the fake $ is being called out, they will turn to their "own" - nihilism at work. - logical, calculated, cold.</p>
