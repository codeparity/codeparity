<p>for the uninitiated, and still intrigued - the real reason i havent been sued till now...is not a mystery but a real life check-mate of sorts</p>
<p>if they sue me, i being a 0, get "noticed"</p>
<p>i have the docs</p>
<p>the docs lead to a slew of "intelligent" ppl, in sarkari banks, in global mnc, etc - who have normalized selling info as their "value" in the "market"</p>
<ul>
<li>similar to bank scammer/callers who hold your info, keep a tab on your financial run ins/issues and are helpful to sweep in your time of needs </li>
</ul>
<p>same thing, just that instead of phone numbers, the incompetence of these ppl is captured on those documents</p>
<p>i was supposed to be a scrape goat - to feed the punjabi/pakistani - superior race / intelligent worthy ppl</p>

<p>not done, actually...now i get started. </p>

<p>in computational terms - distributed systems scale well</p>
<p>consensus, in a human society is a product of mass awareness- consciousness </p>
<p>the psy hack of "feelings" which validate "a version of success" is "unsaid mass consensus"</p>
<p>$$ is absolutely useless to me...but it serves a purpose, a hack</p>
<p>a hack which validates a conflicting idea...suddenly becomes "likeable"</p>
<p>i would share my "gestalt" ...but it needs to be earned...else it would be as useless as blah blah done on this baldies and alfreds - who are an "example" in this live exercise of "merit" or "idea"</p>
<ul>
<li>i make it interesting to keep it engaging for me...it is a pattern for me now, they just dont know how many "invisible" baldies lie in my path...already..just an observation</li>
</ul>

<p>this is latest - after banning a world renowned doctor, it is an "Indian" which is at the receiving end of youtube's morality policing.</p>
<p>Context : an Indi video creator - called "String"'s content was banned and taken down.</p>
<p>String creates content to bring out true/factual history of India</p>
<p>(minus pathans and their time travel inventions, and british master's manifestation of toilet paper)</p>
<p>Anything which builds confidence of Indian native population is extremely problematic to Indian alfreds who milk the "indian" label to beg for those jobs.</p>
<p>Pichai/Kerala boot polish cloud - i wrote to all about the theft of "hacker paradise" - "detailed account plans" - ip addresses, phone of personnel, os, versions, lan org, nat, firewall vendors</p>

<p>then they have to "pretend" they care...while 'leaders' instruct them to 'bury' the matter to get a fat promotion or "thanks" of some kind...</p>
<p>how they ll use "stress" as an "in" to declare anything which discredits you - allegations of worst kind ( even ridiculous - like some divorsed lady being "harassed" when she call me at 11 pm.....why...i had it recorded...knew the snakies....that too...in lockdown corona times..)</p>
<p>the reaction of "on my side" "people-ops" lady was amazing when i told her that i talked to a lawyer....she flipped..</p>
<p>it was like a hitman missed his shot...the "settlement" - well she knew the answer to that...</p>
<p>toxic is "understatement" - will write about it some day - actually they did make me document all that...will just share when the "time" is right.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>longer lasting "non polluting" cars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people can "innovate" when a car is deemed unworthy - swap in lipo for ...lets say a hydrogen generator</p>

<li>
<p>would make the "deal" cleaner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustainable, reaching where there is no cell connectivity</p>
</li>

<p>It wont ever happen - The glory of resurrecting a decades old concept with the razzmatazz of real life iron man - people are virtually in love with these "voluntary sign-offs of their will" - so called modern life, to become modern sheep</p>
<p>it is the iphone story all over again - people craving for society approval and endorsing a company which makes "no bones" about creating a "closed ecosystem"</p>
<p>the closed ecosystem leads to 15 minute cities - at mercy of ppl who make "no bones" about their "intents" - and hey, i absolutely believe in their book - history is totally spot on - you got to admire the simplicity of algorithm.</p>
<p>so the green ppl create fear, the messiahs solve for fear - using tech</p>
<p>this all leads to a good world - where anyone can be anyone in metaverse</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>which feels silly coz of zuki's apparent genius</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would feel awesome when muskie plugs in the neuralink</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>....all the world is sorted ...the "feeling" is the ultimate hack - and muskie is on target to hit that</p>
<p>i like my real dopamine, not a video game, cgi induced "kick" which some rich billionaire delegates an ai to scale.</p>
<p>nueralink is the literal "matrix" connector - we are the generation which plugs itself in.</p>

<p>6.5 inches+  screens - tablets were those size</p>
<p>someone decided that phones are to be used for "video" consumption - the educative kinds or work...it is the illusion...net result is the "black mirror" (awesome series)</p>
<p>this choice means that you literally have to carry this divide to even listen to music.</p>
<p>apple jobs was a real psy hacker - calligraphy, music - he hacked "feelings" first</p>
<p>online only content is the lure which starts it, music libraries, itunes, cloud, convenience, the availability of it, reliability .... all to replace the rs 30 cd in friday market...</p>

<p>it means he thinks his kind is "needed"</p>
<p>assured of "money" and its value - as if he knows the game...</p>
<p>capitalism has perverted that "innovation" to spread itself....the best example is bitcoin - unknown origins - hailed as a virtual messiah in crypto world</p>
<p>it simply was a test of times to come...and people chose it over religion - hardware, electricity, internet, money - all to lay ground to create an absolutely loyal following of souls - a new digital religion</p>
<p>like real estate or anything really - "value" can be an illusion and there cannot be a bigger example</p>
<p>those rigs...the valuation of ai hw and sw industry..it is all seems like an illusion - a choice made by each of us everyday for dependence on these entities - the tech gods or the stock gods - the enterprises</p>
<p>i am not about stopping it or even resisting it...in fact...we ll make money from it</p>
<p>the signup - users choice.

<p>magnetism, induction...as old as modern capitalism itself...yet no breakthroughs even after invention of computers</p>
<p>more diseases than cures - seems like windows.</p>
<p>money is not fake now, not for a "lot" of us.</p>
<p>true jugaad innovation wins over "hacks" - it is borne our of necessity, not an intent to "hack"</p>
