<p>revisit last few years, specifically after 2019</p>
<p>a virus is released</p>
<p>govts/corps of the world dole out free money</p>
<p>people get detached - illusion of climbing a stair in maslow's hierarchy of needs</p>
<p>most splurge - cars, investments etc - assured of the way they are - well taken care off</p>
<p>In last year itself - the veil is becoming thinner by the day - held by some artificial, yet invisible force</p>
<p>It can be a natural disaster, or a war - to force a change in habits</p>
<p>Watchmen shows what "heroes" do, to unite the lesser folk.</p>
<p>This orb/worldcoin/retinal scan thing - it is the decider - the choice.</p>
<p>They will psy op teens into it - snap chit, twatter, other stuff i am not even aware off - would make this sound hip/cool/futuristic</p>
<p>-they will do real good too - like bigtech once did</p>
<p>-the trust or the need - whatever gives in first!!</p>
<p>Local govts losing control of eco, law</p>
<p>Inflation - natural or induced or psuedo natural - doesnt really matter</p>
<p>Natural disasters - with local telecoms failing =&gt; starlink - ironman coming to rescue</p>
<p>"earth" is getting hotter - it should and it must - wef says so</p>
<p>haarp is imaginary, so is cloud seeding...</p>
<p>sleep easy - it is all going to roll over....state would take care of it.</p>

<p>Joker doesnt even remember his tragedy...his whole shtick is to really unscrew batman....to break him as a hobby...he seems to have the ability - intellectual as well as physical...resource rich despite - no money or even "purpose"</p>
<p>not really cox he wants to, or needs to...it is just that he is "free" to do it if Batman is not really there....the world seems to sort itself out for him...</p>
<p>in a weird way...joker respects balance and the ability of society to self correct itself...no matter how tragic the events leading upto it might be - true Christianity, Karma - all good religious stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>the choice is with the bearer - ppl decide - not influenced -psy-oped into doing "good"</li>
</ul>
<p>batman .... for him...it is a hunt of sorts.... a problem, a disease which lies with society itself....incurable...unsolvable? </p>
<p>subtle hints...thomas wayne was a doctor...by profession.</p>
<p>batman always has a catwomen or something to remind him "pappa - ghar aa jaana" ;)</p>
<p>there is way more to Alan moore...

<p>Gif from the killing joke : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke</p>
<p>It is like a modern Gita in a graphic novel....more gruesome...much misleading...seemingly to sort out people - on what they want to see....</p>
<p>Doubling down on delusions, as i do :</p>
<p>Alan moore is a genius, as well as the most sarcastic writer ever...</p>
<p>if you really understand Batman Vs Joker....</p>
<p>Joker might come out to be the hero - the one who has no choice....</p>
<p>Batman always did - still has</p>
<p>Isnt he the richest/most influential/well respected</p>
<p>in white knight fashion - he can choose to legalize or control anything - law, influence or money - all at his disposal - the 3 forms of matrix..</p>
<p>..yet he puts on a cape to rescue....with whole of capitalism at its disposal</p>
<p>he is as self destructive ....even more so as the joker.....</p>
<p>Thats Alan Moore slapping us in the face....all dark knight aficionados ....</p>

<p>People are hoping that it would get better - it would, but not for your avg outsourced job based worker - it would get increasingly rewarding to get "hands on", rather than 'projections'.</p>
<p>This week and subsequent year - it would really shatter some egos, whether we like them or not.</p>

<p>A future cannot be created in isolation - i am very well aware of it.</p>
<p>For that, i will form a team of strays - will invest in them in all ways to make "wolves" out of them - brave and stupid enough to really protect their family, community and hence country</p>
<p>A distributed system scales well - there are patterns hidden in reptoid tech - for their thought process - they see us as programs, psyoped into "execution" or dependence by force if necessary.</p>
<p>A future cannot also be created in explaining the "merit" to competing habitus companions</p>
<p>respect changes its value when existence is at lowest level - nihilism</p>
<p>Our haarp =&gt; manipur, punjab, rajastan, west bengal are indicators of Indias' participation in this.</p>
<p>WHO setting HQ in Guj</p>
<p>Bollywood??</p>
<p>Minority appeasement</p>
<p>No real reforms - police, judicial - netas/parties would only create extremes and milk the most sensitive one - global fact</p>
<p>no one is coming to save you or me - there is no neo, we need to trust our skills - or really if you like metaverse and kids at state's disposal - no judgment - tc and be happy in Neom</p>
<p>for those father/mothers - who have suffered and see the "suffering" with no respite in sight - logically or practically - intellectual judges and genius politicians - our HM is the best ever!!</p>
<p>A simple geo location based analysis at telecom providers' end would provide all the "genius" clues and the network of all "nice ppl"</p>
<p>but it wont be ever done - the system works for people who create and protect it</p>
<p>it is not that bad - it is badly hack-able - you just have to really look at it again - disern</p>
<p>Money, freedom, privacy - all for the ones who really deserve it, and are willing to really work though self bias.</p>
<p>So really, wake up.</p>

<p>true diversity is accepting people for who they are, correcting them if they are at imbalance with nature, respect.</p>
<p>wef/alfreds version of convoluting "diversity" with "globalization" via tech, fear and global supply chain is really a focused attempt at destroying local cultures and lifestyle.</p>
<p>ppl scratched head when flipfart was valued at B$$, even i did.</p>
<p>a $ backed by nothing is just a tool to gather intel on us, kids, habits.</p>
<p>Walmart, amazon are debt/investment based enterprises with alleged Minor Attracted Persons on board...maybe</p>
<p>Whiterock/Asguard adhere to ESG, something imagined by English masters. Alfreds hide their presence.</p>
<p>Best companies of the world gobble us best talent on fake $, make them fat, lazy, rich and general "gifts to society"</p>
<p>all they do is make money, get consumed in it, cox baby no one tells them about real truth of existence = a balance with env, a realistic version of their own happiness, not the boogle/instagram/pathan version of it</p>
<p>it is not really about being popular</p>
<p>the truth is in stats - 1 % will lead</p>
<p>if those 1% are rational, the 99% will follow</p>
<p>eg the "agree?" like sheep, the tedx speakers etc 😀 </p>
