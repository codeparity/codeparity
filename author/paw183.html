<p>3 sides to a triangle, minimum for balance - a tripod etc.</p>
<p>3 cities are interesting to discover or visit or research</p>
<p>They form and control our world/matrix, now and in past.</p>
<p>Vatican City</p>
<p>officially Vatican City State is a landlocked independent country, city-state, microstate, and enclave within Rome, Italy.</p>
<p>"the moral compass of the world."</p>
<p>Washington, D.C</p>
<p>is not a part of any U.S. state and is not one itself. The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River</p>
<p>"the implementation arm."</p>
<p>London city</p>
<p>The people who rule this city are wizards of the language which restricts my expression. I will use the "inherited liberty" of my country to call them "nice masters" </p>
<p>many ppl call it the financial capital, to me it is much more - they create divides - the "intellect of the world", the exploit creators - financial, racial, geographical etc</p>
<p>3 layers of matrix.</p>
<p>cmdline params = vatican</p>
<p>runtime inputs = london</p>
<p>interrupts = washington</p>
<p>They are independent entities/countries in themselves - if anyone missed the fact.</p>

<p>I was a good runtime debugger. Learned log analysis from the best.</p>
<p>combine that with being a good coder, you kind of become a good runtime debugger.</p>
<p>twitter feeds are like running logs - one just needs to put in live, relevant filters</p>
<p>we really are running a very dumb runtime - hence this stack state - lack of memory and all</p>

<p>It is quite logical if one thinks about it</p>
<p>Dogs were ones Wolves - Independent and Fierce </p>
<p>We were fierce once - Survival/Evolution with neanderthals proves that</p>
<p>Wolves became dogs because they found some comfort, some security with Humans, hence a sacred/understanding, an old bond was formed - they protect, we feed</p>
<p>Humans found a similar protector,feeder in Govts/Banks. We have explicit agreements - birth certs, money statements etc</p>
<p>Both relationships are based on trust</p>
<p>Both seem equally one sided and biased.</p>
<p>Similarities dont end there</p>
<p>Humans were injected with an "alleged bioweapon" - by all govts, all docs, researchers worldwide - the cumulative decision made out of panic, projection, false news by false gods and sources</p>
<p>India, hindutva, Gods' own country - culling dogs in bunch </p>
<p>-when BJP is in power</p>
<p>-Kerala being "educated"</p>
<p>-CM Shashi tharoor being intelligent and all</p>
<p>-Fathers' Nation - Gandhi giving gyaan about nation being judged by its treatment of animals and all</p>
<p>-ESG guidelines focus on cruelty/meat free world, while Mumbai/bjp ruled apartment has goats to be culled and celebrated</p>
<p>-When the BJP minister of animal empathy entitlement has been doing a great job for last decades</p>
<p>=&gt;both are based on "expert assessment" by their respective owners/gods</p>
<p>=&gt;both are equally helpless, yet wont realize it</p>
<p>both are at mercy, at faith, yet so ignorant of the force that just holds itself back because of respect, convenience</p>
<p>Dogs will become wolves - unfed, hunted only make wild animals - something which the lib world keeps crying about - trauma</p>
<p>more accurately - revenge. Animals dont and cant reason</p>
<p>we will see as green culture dominated kerala and their intellectuals are really educated or ...</p>
<p>Dogs/Humans will evolve - we dont have a choice in this - both are hunted</p>
<p>Evolution is just adaptation for survival</p>
