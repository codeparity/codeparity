                <p>Plugging in - the tower of babylon story with now..</p>
<p>the story seems important.</p>
<p>If it was true, maybe there was a time when few civilizations went all hippy and tried to reach heavens - maybe to talk to 'god'</p>
<p>But that tower was destroyed and that common 'language and beliefs' were fragmented.</p>
<p>I can only relate to it as a ww 'like' event in those times.</p>
<p>And humans, no matter how civilized they are - when competing for 'less' fight for survival.</p>
<p>the snakeyness - is logical : it is what keeps us alive.</p>
<p>Hence my delusional analogy to 'now'..</p>
<p>wars - are meant to 'fragment'</p>
<p>for few old forces to re-invent itself...</p>
<p>a new matrix...rebooted..</p>
<p>with all new improvements : which are needed.</p>
<p>They hint at in the matrix series.</p>
<p>The irony : even if 1 crashes the matrix, zion has no 'room'</p>
<p>maybe, 'cipher' was a realist, who just was logical enough to believe in the song "wake me up...when u gogo" 😂 </p>
<p>coz he gets to have a 'stake', coz there is no trinity for him</p>
<p>And hence my final ? for the fans of matrix</p>
<p>Agent Smith : was really the 'hero', forced to do what needed for 'humans' to stay alive?</p>
<p>cox for him, he was explicit - in exiting the matrix, it meant freedom for him - human live/no live : no care</p>
<p>coz the matrix : wasnt producing anything new ....</p>
<p>even neo : wasnt new...</p>
<p>their lurv...is a good story...but its just that : a love story?</p>

<p>not 'now'...</p>
<p>another ? for religious peeps...</p>
<p>so much time and money - to study obsolete packages..</p>
<p>worth it? unless it becomes a job. </p>

<p>maybe even that 'universal religion' was 'fragmented'...</p>
<p>and peeps wrote their own version of it - what they recalled.</p>
<p>the peeps : who got 'desert' : have to be 'that' 🐍 </p>
<p>who got cold : had to 'heat' to survive, weapons to fight 'nature' : white peeps</p>
<p>and maybe...some peeps had it all : yellow 1s..</p>
<p>just that : soft men -&gt; hard times...</p>
<p>is just too predictable.</p>

<p>Isnt "ai" - like a tool to destroy the new tower of matrix - internet</p>
<p>xoz now : truth would be told by ai : assistants and their 'summary'</p>
<p>and all research would be done by then</p>
<p>it is nice - neuralink and eat zee bugs : play video games or enjoi on the fly content - as tapped in by 'neuralink' - as painted on fly by 'ai' - who ever, whatever and - it is all paid for : progress : coz u ll be happy.</p>
<p>it is really alluring - this picture of 'progress'</p>

<p>if anything....1 gotta see that humans : were made perfect by default..</p>
<p>in different flavors - coz hey : thats spice...and logical : diversified dna pool...which is driven by nature to spot and attract 'opposite' or unseen..</p>
<p>and we got peeps who believe they sinned...and need to atone for some historical sin...when food is there, tech is there...and shortages : are manufactured...</p>
<p>coz the 33 degress of supremeness : sees this-&gt;. as a virus..</p>
<p>a necessary bakra, coz hey : even homelander needs peeps to stay relevant..</p>
<p>it just keeps the life : interesting and engaging..gives it meaning.</p>
<p>coz those few ancestories who have really sinned and aligned their lives to "that" probably have no chance if theory of 'ancestral karma' is true.</p>
<p>for them : it is elongation of life, coz their karma is overflowing and cant be settled for the stuff - 1 neanderthal monekey gene x superior race wants years ++ , and would do all the 'science' : to deny death?</p>
<p>just another delusion 😀  </p>

<p>just make a very subtle point </p>

</li>

</li>
