<p>Ramayana and Mahabharata...</p>
<p>some less known aspects...</p>
<p>how some 'brahmins' were taken to task by lord Rama.. ðŸ¤£ </p>
<p>"</p>
<p>The epic Ramayana does not mention Sarama herself. </p>
<p>However, it does mention an incident in which the god Rama punishes a Brahmin for beating a Sarameya â€“ descendant of Sarama â€“ for no reason. </p>
<p>The epic Mahabharata has a similar story. In the first book of the epic Adi Parva, king Janamejaya's brothers beat up a dog, who comes near Janamejaya's yajna site. </p>
<p>The crying dog complains to its mother Sarama that it was beaten by Janamejaya's brothers for no reason. </p>
<p>Sarama reaches Janamejaya's sacrifice site and curses him that since he has harmed her son without reason, unseen danger will befall him. The curse frightens the king and he finds a priest, named Somashravas, to free him from the curse. In the second book, Sabha Parva, Sarama is listed among the many goddesses that worship the god Brahma in his court or are members of his court. In the third book, Vana Parva, Sarama is listed among the Matrika ("Mothers") or manushya-grahas (evil spirits), who are allowed by their "son", the war-god Skanda to devour children under the age of sixteen. It says Sarama, the mother of all dogs, Lord of the world, snatches human fetuses from wombs</p>

<p>which means the ai is even less capable than 90s baldies genius..</p>
<p>which means - just bleah blah . no work ðŸ¤£ </p>
