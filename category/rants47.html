<p>all this 'blah' would soon start looking believable - the times we are in...</p>

<li>
<p>solar storms and disruptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>volcano activity</p>

<p>'accidental' human spillage/leakage OOPsies - vax, mRNA rootkit, the bio - os, the notification messaging .... all deals to not think much... ðŸ˜€ </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'news' wont be reported - the altman switcharoo (steve jobs++) elevation needs the 'spotlight' - new tech god is here..it is much like holly/bollywood tech script in geek owned world...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>then...what is going behind it all the 'fear' is 1 basic fact - we depend on 'masters'</p>
<p>our yesses, likes are 'pre - installed' in knowledge, job trainings etc</p>
<p>baphomet and its existence seems real - day by day...</p>
<p>wonder if it is a real creature....godzilla, or "kotal kahn" types ...</p>
<p>delusional? </p>
<p>if aliens are real - and that is 1 story/disclosure that would be really 'timed'  - it is the ultimate predator tactic...</p>

                <p>Some logical blahblah about Tech in India - observations, now, and maybe...</p>
<p>some context - good english speakers, malleable, non corrosive culture - perfect tax payers.</p>
<p>tech - seems natural for all "science" written in eng..</p>
<p>so phy, science etc - seemed to be 'achievement' - hence iits etx</p>
<p>$fuelled 'innovation' in India - what sells in west kinds..</p>
<p>flipfart, zemazon - etc  data, habits, patterns - likes, desires etc ...</p>
<p>mostly alfreds/abduls - with different 'personal time' dejjjires.</p>
<p>mtv world - then bollywood made "gems" of intellectual capabilities of pathans by pathans - all awesome</p>
<p>perfect complaint - yes mans - loyal poodles.</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>$ magic is fading away - but clawing at last straw</p>
<p>$ internet cant work on genuine money - it was the imaginary $ and dejjires of 'fine life - cannibals' and all - just wanting "diversity" in flavor - empire - control...</p>
<p>where is the "money"??</p>
<p>If Bharat becomes China of Food - good, non expensive 1.</p>
<p>Tech has limits of utility - when the motion and movement is still dependent on a coil and magnet - i dont really think there is much to fear - master are just being funny - angrez version of it ðŸ˜€ </p>

<p>masters need ppl to remain masters - so anything $ would never really become 0 </p>
<p>even by a delusional perspective - they always need and want alfreds, strays - abduls etx....</p>
<p>in my delusional mind...it is a x between 2 strains of entirely different kinds...so there would be no debate about "natural" origins now...</p>
<p>parity - master, alfreds, abduls, strays - would be maintained - no matter what the 'right' one is - the universe seems to be saying so since 2000 known years...but...everyone is right.. ðŸ˜€ </p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i literally applied art of motorcycle maintenance to - art of tata nano maintenance...</p>
<p>a car with all the potential in world - yet a 0</p>
<p>...there was a lot of repair, healing to be done...</p>
<p>kind of repeated my own journey - went to $ doctors - workshop etc...only to see the 'official' apathy...</p>
<p>then it kind of became a 0 - even abduls saw it as a cow of cash.. ðŸ˜€ </p>
<p>it then became symbiotic...car healed me, and i healed her...now we kinda building it all up..</p>

<p>gads - they work on 'propensity' to buy - how do you think they calculate that??</p>
<p>psy/op - a very important part of $ subservience - too hard to resist - again the serpent story..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>data - just check the returns by major fmcg companies in last few years...</p>
<p>baba hype went down obviously - it was perverted shariya taxpaying ayurveda hybrid - too weird to last.</p>
