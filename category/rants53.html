<p>His definition of 'entitlement' - soft hacks - respect and all</p>

<p>only matter of time it ends up at office wifi...</p>
<p>wifi cred...his cred...then one can osint the linkedin profiles of employees, their duties...the lan systems, which assume "lan ness"...they carry the most valueable info...fin etc</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>u see how practical it is...the same story goes for every employee.</p>
<p>the family thing at profession is a necessity... the oldies know...i guess nihilism is the real lesson learned to become a 'leader'</p>

<li>the bohime between serpent apple, 666ogle and mecro$oft is an apparent - if one considers how 'mac' is used, trusted and frankly way more controlled than their 'glorious' internal distro which doesnt even work on corp hw...yeah just 2/3 pieces...still no one is genius enough to figure out a working config</li>

<p>After ~12 years, kids grow up, and well - an "unknown disease"</p>
<p>Coincidence</p>
<p>or a barely qualified engineer playing doctor, researcher ie new age god?</p>
<p>Why would someone do this "deliberately"?</p>
<p>truth seems stranger than fiction - specially when "education" is "indoctrination"</p>
<p>Time seems to rhyme with the theme of last few years - chaos - all "god made" - climate change is real.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>about $</p>
<p>most fin prophets in west are not really getting it - they think brics will announce some "global currency"...</p>
<p>they really need to revisit history - barter - between countries.</p>
<p>it makes sense for all these - they produce and consume - food, fuel, metals etc</p>
<p>so it is really an exchange - there maybe a currency, but the "concept" is barter not baselining and then trading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Evolution - as taught in science, means an organism is "programmed" to evolve to its environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vaccination - is "needed" for "everything" when the human body has survived thousands of years - some tribes still are "unvaccinated"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These statements can be true in a marvel movie, but not in "science" or rather - logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Power of Money - appoint an Indian Alfred to run the "enterprise"</p>
<p>The very real cost of failure wont let him give up, the "indian" thing is in vogue - hardwork of ancestors - "utilized" by unkle billy!</p>
<p>Alfred frees up unkle billy's bandwidth to do "good" around the world</p>
<p>Fake $, fake meds, fake gods and real consequences on the "sheep"</p>
<p>dont feel bad coz it happened in Africa - a poor country...happened in India, now happening in their own "xountries"</p>
<p>masters are really fair - they dont really discriminate - now that the fake $ is being called out, they will turn to their "own" - nihilism at work. - logical, calculated, cold.</p>

<p>preachers who mutilate a newborn's body to 'recognize and welcome' him/her in their clan....</p>
<p>symbolically and practically, it may mean that the way the baby is born - is not perfect as per "worshiped god of clan" - all coz someone somewhere - 2000 years before thought he/she/it can perfect a baby - with an incision and loss of some skin.. ðŸ˜‚ </p>
<p>no "rationality" can be applied when it is done by "billions"</p>
<p>then there is the "animal sacrifice"...</p>
<p>then there are specific uses of 'animals/species' - dictated by oh so wise 1 - in past - who might qualify to be genius in those times 0 BC</p>
