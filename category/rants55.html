<blockquote>
<p>The "trans" thing works on various levels of capitalism</p>
<p>-money flows: med makes money from "grants/taxes"</p>
<p>-opium for next gens...keep them consumed in 1 organ and its uses  - CN is opium example, this one is dopium one...no resistance when families/communies are broken</p>
<p>-psy/op - divide and control of "repelleous"(rebel+repel)  kids</p>
<p>teens are known to get along with parents- historical fact</p>
<p>so they wont be tempted to "oppose" each and everything their "out of tune" parent might say...</p>
<p>they never leave home or do things just to "tick off" authority figures</p>
<p>so this law and people who dream it...dont really know how the "feelings of few" might be conflicting with "feelings of the majority tax payer - who is busy passing "dei" compliance for his bigtech employer..and they do have those "sessions" where they hunt the people to speak on "pressing issues"</p>
<p>money really sets you free.

<p>Billy is yet to even say "oopsie" for vax</p>
<p>indian alfred wont ever admit being a party to covid misinformation or suppression (he might have to - contris to dems...)</p>
<p>media "ken" would use "cn" as proxy to "abstract" the dirty business of clean energy - cobalt, lithium or battery is not a generator</p>
<p>intelligent or evil - it is just a perspective... 😀 </p>
<p>they are rich, so intelligent and well intended - media says so too..</p>
<p>bigtech calls the shot in california - take whatever happens there as their "grand genius" plan for the world</p>
<p>eg - driverless cars etc</p>
<p>billion $ means they are good and people to trust....and maybe this really is the "right" thing to do ?
</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need to share all this - surely ppl of California were too busy to know what they are paying for...</p>
<p>Leader of the world are busy giving "esg/dei" speeches - without knowing what it leads to?</p>
<p>A salary to brainwash someone's kid......permanently.</p>
<p>Works - everyone was just doing their "job" - they dint know what "harm" it might cause!!!</p>

<p>While this change creates new opportunities, few of the much needed improvements in our lives would be</p>

<li>
<p>less propaganda : the fake $ money which pumped the "news" - the celebs. the saviors etc, cannot just ride on ESG related mandates - enforced by WEF via BlackRock, Vanguard etc</p>

<li>
<p>innovation : the fake $ and its "investment" arms - the holier than thou Thiels, investment ponies like nappster SA etc cant just acquire tech to bury it under pits of western capitalism which rules by eco subservience</p>

<p>I know the why and how, it is as logical as belief, if one "zooms" out correctly</p>
<p>a "gestalt" like the nice person "describes" it</p>
<p>a must watch  <span class="videobox">
                    <iframe width="640" height="390"

<p>like everyone, my "gestalt" seems to be tuned.</p>
<p>it is not magic.</p>
<p>it doesnt require any guru-ness</p>
<p>it doesnt even require you to ack me or my stray existence....</p>
<p>just follow the prophet...question it...its motives, logic...everything</p>
<p>and then you will know.</p>
<p>How to get there - its is all pure science and logic - links are all in there in my posts....but it starts with a belief...an investment in "you", not in anyone else or any gyaani.</p>

<p>some amazing tools</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dXrCUUwa</p>
<p>https://spacevim.org/</p>
<p>I completely missed existence of neovim, this was a great discovery</p>
<p>https://nvchad.com/</p>
<p>Github is awesome</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/diaB7br9</p>
<p>my homebrew is tested, works - still looking for optimizations...</p>
<p>cant really go truely digital - did send some festive greetings via sdcards, pendrives.</p>
<p>i hope i am not re-inventing the wheel here...if "there is an app" for that, let me know.</p>
