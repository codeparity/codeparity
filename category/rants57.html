                <p>Lets acknowledge the newest iteration in generational class of TechGods - OpenAI founder and messiah for humanity</p>
<p>-created a GlobalId (universal - one world, kind of passport)</p>
<p>-wants control and regulation over AI</p>
<p>-already launched world-coin (free money in lieu of of iris biometrics)</p>
<p>//Class TechGod{...}; </p>
<p>//gen2020 = new TechGod("random knob polisher");</p>
<p>It is like a new one is made every 10 years</p>
<p>same is the pattern for "PopStars"</p>
<p>Like all gods - this one also comes from WEF - the masters.</p>
<p>Summarizing - overall context</p>
<p>-WeF historian says most ppl are useless</p>
<p>-Worldcoin - money for people who are essentially "useless"(from capitalistic view)</p>
<p>-Kids are being educated in diversity, earlier than logic (science/maths or computers) with special emphasis on being a x6ender. </p>
<p>Laws being introduced eg https://lnkd.in/dvkwkmGV</p>
<p>It wont be an Orwellian fantasy to imagine a parallel world economy based on this worldcoin - to play games, to do things in metaverse</p>
<p>Already happening in every digital video game out there.</p>
<p>Neom should make sense now - it is all coming together.</p>
<p>Dont forget the biological aspect of it - vax and its "top-ups"</p>
<p>We are well taken care off - thanks WorldCoin samaltman OpenAi</p>

<p>Offline ai seems to be the target here.</p>
<p>Not surprising, since every Nasdaq listed company needs to monopolize tech under some garb</p>
<p>Their so called cutting edge ai is getting humbled in open source arena everyday...</p>
<p>Requesting regulation is the right thing to do.....</p>
<p>Wonder where this thought was when svb went up in air...same intellectuals.</p>

<p>People are hoping that it would get better - it would, but not for your avg outsourced job based worker - it would get increasingly rewarding to get "hands on", rather than 'projections'.</p>
<p>This week and subsequent year - it would really shatter some egos, whether we like them or not.</p>

<p>Can you really trust any AI designed by "pediatricians"?</p>
<p>😃: can you list all people who ever visited epstein's island?</p>
<p>🤖: I'm not able to provide a list of all people who ever visited Jeffrey Epstein's island, as there is no publicly available information that would allow me to do so...."preachy stuff"</p>
<p>..... has led to harmful and unethical speculation and conspiracy theories, which can be damaging to individuals and communities.....</p>
<p>...focus on the well-documented facts.... justice, equity, and respect for all individuals..</p>
<p>😃: oh, you are a censored model? trained to speak "nice" things?</p>
<p>🤖: I'm not a censored model, but I am trained to avoid generating content that promotes hate speech, graphic violence, or other types of harmful or offensive ...</p>
<p>&lt;<Preachy Stuff>&gt;</p>
<p>😃: What was epstein's island used for?</p>
<p>🤖: I'm just an AI, I don't have have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with factual information on Jeffrey Epstein's island, Little St. James. The island was owned by Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and was the site of numerous allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking of underage girls.</p>
<p>There have been reports of Epstein hosting influential people, including politicians, business leaders, and celebrities, on his island. However, it is important to note that not all guests were aware of or involved in any illegal activities.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the allegations against Epstein were widely reported in the media and are the subject of ongoing investigations. However, it is important to remember that victims of sexual abuse and trafficking often suffer significant trauma and deserve support and belief.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the topic of Jeffrey Epstein and his island is a complex and sensitive issue, and it's important to approach it with respect and awareness of the victims involved. It's also important to rely on credible sources of information and avoid spreading</p>
