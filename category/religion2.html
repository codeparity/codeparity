<p>a snake eats its eggs : it is just his nature and his rules</p>
<p>no judgement</p>
<p>but snakeys dont live in cities?</p>
<p>they belong in jungle or desert.</p>
<p>white.exe : is a layer above : the animalistic 1</p>
<p>they plan, but for few years...</p>
<p>the most evolved 1 : brit masters who serve baphomet</p>
<p>aware of its needs, creating the matrix as it serves him...</p>
<p>creating chaos at will, to pull magic before adhd peeps</p>
<p>the tictactoe : is universal...mah own creation.</p>

<p>unfortunately : the popular version of hindu.exe is also reduced to 'animistic' layer 1 : due to inaction </p>
<p>a mind F hack of psy op : gandhian and hard inforced by law</p>
<p>a law, which neuters instances of hindu.exe to forgo wars, ignore much - to hold on to that corporate job, where they can escape this - go to a 'fair; country like 'ca' 'au' etx</p>
<p>it doesnt matter : the matrix is drawn by brit masters : globalization, progress and empathy : hacked universally.</p>
<p>hindu.exe is no diff.</p>

<p>but it has gotten terrible and predictable</p>
<p>and frankly - offensive to data/stats and logic</p>
<p>green peeps:</p>
<p>painted as calm/sane peeps</p>
<p>incest in hindu.exe, while the green areas are all 'holy' and 'peaceful'</p>
<p>while lurv to all : relationships are no bound for green.exe : just a prayer to popet and all is forgotten : coz living is misery, and their lives are a mission.</p>
<p>just the director is bollywodia &amp;&amp; green</p>
<p>his actors are green</p>
<p>and the cause of all this psy/op propoganda..</p>
<p>is just the end of meat factory called bollywood.</p>
<p>the 'industry' which claims to 'guide' and 'entertain'...</p>
<p>but all it does is paint incestual green peeps are creative and genius</p>
<p>adreno - chrome : something which makes a pathaan swell up</p>
<p>or swell down..</p>
<p>there is no magic in all this...</p>
<p>just the proof : that a pretty young girl : salyan, can be butchered : without a trace in democraxy of britness </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>where the default father figure of amit bacchan, becomes all knowin/all wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yet a bihar born star - SSR, becomes an eternal suicide mystery, coz bollywoda and puulice and desi cia : all want to preserve 'green peace'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>are we free?</p>
<p>really?</p>
<p>the most popular/pretty/rich peeps : dissaper without a trace.</p>
<p>and yet : we have a rockin home minister who specialized in cutting ropes.</p>

<p>the weakness in green.exe : they want a 'khalifa' : the 1 to fear and pray to</p>
<p>their 90s khalifa : begging for pullice protection</p>
<p>their other khalifa : raising drug peddlers</p>
<p>the other : doing green things with other countries</p>
<p>these are rich green peeps..</p>
<p>they are khalifa of 5 footiya gym pumping pathaans...</p>
<p>they ll get a khalifa : just that it wont be 'green'...but orange 😂 
</p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i already know the 'will' of bihar origin peeps : their 'son' and yet : silence.</p>
<p>there is a reason...being from bihar, or being a bihari is considered 'offensive' something to hide.</p>
<p>it is word : the self bias gives it a -ve meaning</p>
<p>bihariness : its upto biharis to prove the 'quality'</p>
<p>useless to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rooted in 'present' yet, cm is an opportunist, which will do morally compromising things - it is predictable</p>
<p>i left it after 2 episodes</p>
<p>cm yogi, would be back with a vengence, and it is predictable: he ll solve for it..</p>
<p>and then a film industry in UP...would solve for all the green bias.</p>
<p>this is going to happen, coz i know akumas.</p>

<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all 'warring' gangs are 'hindu.exe'</p>
<p>the chump protagonist : goes from revenge to logic : power and its quest</p>
<p>logical peeps would ve collected habitus and went to some other country</p>
<p>but logic is not is green director..or his imagination</p>
<p>renaming green gangs to hindu, and making illogical masala stuff - hallmark of that dhakkan</p>

<ul>
<li>all of a sudden?  😁 </li>
</ul>
<p>It is the layer of existence</p>
<p>the snakeyness - is the nihilistic layer</p>
<p>the lizard brain : the one which do as it sees</p>
<p>a servant of senses.</p>
<p>btw - snake lays egss. </p>
<p>ie not even in same class - mammals</p>
<dl>
<dt>the next layer : how we plan or think</dt>
<dd>
<p>conscious, deliberate thought...</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>ie intelligence and its limit - mammals.</p>
<p>this is where hyena/wolfie and other animals instinct kick in.</p>
<p>this is over and over snakey/nihilistic layers.</p>
<p>the 'strategies' and the 'reaction' built in by 'default'</p>
<p>2000 years of 'human evolution'</p>
<p>yet - we have 1 % ruling the 'democraxy'</p>
<p>it becomes clear : we are lead by 'apex' of different kinds,</p>
<p>which defines education, activities and 'holidays' too</p>
<p>if i am 1% - brit neanderthal money croxx incestual intelligence..</p>
<p>then, its pretty clear : what would 1 % do...</p>
<p>they design 'mirages' : of enlightenment, money and wars.</p>
<p>hence this ?</p>
<p>do we even 'think' </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>just 'recall' what someone 'dead long ago' thought?</p>
<p>genius : is knowing a lot of books - who said what and when</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>it is knowing what needs be done 'now' and hence in 'future'</p>
<p>coz, baba has it 'pre-calculated' 😂 </p>
<p>religion - ultimately tell us : there is no choice</p>
<p>and there is. </p>
<p>hence this.</p>

<p>i am guessing - past civilization were quite smart.</p>
<p>they talked in 'symbology'</p>
<p>hence 'thoth'</p>
<p>the 1 who has head of a bird : eyes of eagle and beak as mouth</p>
<p>symbology : being precision and he sees all - from a wider lens</p>
<p>..maybe eats less : just like a bird. definitely 'light' enough</p>
<p>same symbology : is apparent in different N hindu Gods.</p>
<p>we just see - different : coz we are taught different : from centuries, in daily survival of 'nihilism' -food/job/etx.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>intoxication : substance abuse...</p>
<p>starts with 'plant stuff'...</p>
<p>but like any addiction, 1 focussed on next high?</p>
<p>remember : a junkie likies when he touches life/death line...</p>
<p>Overdose : a typical char of a junkie..</p>
<p>what would the ultimate junkie do? </p>
<p>what is the ultimate poison ? rarest 1? natural 1?</p>
<p>snakey juice?</p>
<p>it is ... and it is there where it gets twisted..</p>
<p>this life/death boundary stuff : called near death exp..is all enlightening and knowing.</p>
<p>but, 1 doesnt have to be a baba to know this - any adreno junkie is doing the same stuff - legal/illegal is just a perspective.

<p>To really dig deep into the sigmaness of gAmit and his poorer clones - gTurds</p>
<p>1 need not even think a bit...</p>
<p>its simple:</p>
<p>It is a short term need to end : a day at 1</p>
<p>Addictions of 'mind' : makes you addicted to 'cheap' wins</p>
<p>dopamine addiction - happiness addiction : all relative to saturation levels 1s sensors have reached</p>
<p>an activity - any : professional/personal : needs to elevate in 'experience'</p>
<p>it may be cycling, or just expectation of wins..</p>
<p>or just expectations of expectations : the self farts which baldies smell</p>
<p>In their minds - they start at 1 and end at 1++</p>
<p>not ever returning to 0</p>
<p>thats being 'high' or being 'addicted'</p>
<p>when 'salaries' are just 'entitlements' and baldies : playing the bigger switcharoo within industry baldies..</p>
<p>the values and decisions : rarely coherent</p>
<p>when bijness is slow, gossips run wild</p>
<p>entertainment is just making up delusions...</p>
<p>and delusions...tend to come true.</p>

<p>It is not 'modern' to talk about 'this'</p>
<p>this is just old radical peeps - doing radical stuf. - misguided youth</p>
<p>etc...</p>

<p>that md - degree : accredited at birth : is the real problem</p>
