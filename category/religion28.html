<p>Can anyone be judged for a choice which 1 thinks is </p>
<p>'impossible &gt; unsafe &gt; safe &gt; $$ &gt; fame &gt; pure &gt; impure &gt; restore &gt; pure'??</p>
<p>ie if perceived fear is considered 'societal practice' than can anyone have any moral say on it?</p>
<p>abdul or alfred? </p>
<p>Karma - the psy op is there for a purpose - the purposes of baphomet.</p>

<p>as observed and celebrated by people who hate being called sheep, but in reality - hyenas of different colors and creed </p>

<li>
<p>who will turn on each other at the smallest convenience of 'power++' - $$, fame, land, woo-men, etc.</p>
</li>

<p>I had to revisit this story - thought of a short cut - enroll my son at 'bajrang dal' and be done with it</p>
<ul>
<li>i thought it was a modern version of 'gurukul'- Schools as they should be (no pedos)</li>

<p>...then i remembered this telecom pappu and results of this 'investment'</p>
<p>It needed to be re-done.</p>

<p>happened to talk to 1 of them - no passport, no money - 10 years of promise of a 'good' life...</p>

<p>the pundits may do their numerical magic - defy the % in which the balance of 3d universe lies - both are needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>balance</p>
<p>Good/Bad</p>
<p>i really dont know absolute good or bad.</p>
<p>people try, then  hindsight makes people and prophets look 'genius'</p>
<p>I am trying to understand this boundary of good|bad</p>
<p>In nihilism - it is meaningless - just a body's desires as decided by reality and lure of 'feelings' based half of brain - akin to $$++</p>
<p>In medieval times - material might - abduls rules</p>
<p>in 'modern' times - logical might - alfreds rule.</p>
<p>No one can define 'progress' </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>rightfully claim 'good' </p>
<p>unless they cite the holy book or religion </p>
<ul>
<li>the wrongs done by some neanderthal as written by another neanderthal - all near to monkey intellect - $ science tells us that.</li>
</ul>
<p>holy books are not just religion - they are the rule books</p>
<p>name changes, intent doesnt</p>
<p>-religion in medieval times</p>
<p>-science in 'industrialized times'</p>
<p>-'education' in current 'peak' times</p>
<p>all that blah blah - to pose some Q's</p>
<p>who can define good and bad?</p>
<p>leaders know?</p>
<p>preachers/influencers/karma deciders - do they know?</p>
<p>i dont think anyone knows anything - the maya or matrix is 1s understanding and relevance in matrix</p>
<p>just like the hypothetical 'devil/shaitaan/daitya' manifests itself via its hacks - lust, gluttony etc</p>
<p>God, would manifest itself in similar ways - the hacks - temptation to devil.</p>
<p>As above - so below.</p>
<p>all this is known, yet forgotten - newton, karma, nature : it is a universal fact -  each religion agrees.</p>
<ul>
<li>devil and his hacks seem to have executed a DDOS via glam, shimmer, success....</li>
</ul>
<p>the null pointer - i think it manifests in certain conditions....in every habitus.</p>
<p>i gave examples of g_baldie_1 - someone who lost his pointer to 'good' in 'society'</p>
<p>the other 1, of God manifesting itself </p>
<ul>
<li>is when we can really 'work' - free of bias, fear and everything</li>
</ul>
<p>i feel everyone knows this feeling...maybe work, hobby, music or just someone's company.</p>
<p>Dido - the unofficial angel of this hypothetical religion </p>
<ul>
<li>she becomes an angel when she performs/inspires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i dont think the 'feeling' comes from a human - just via a human.</p>
<p>did she need to do yoga or subscribe to antics of iron man? ðŸ˜€ </p>
<p>she knows her 1s and it shows.</p>
<ul>
<li>her journey is interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>i think she was 'discovered' when she tried to 'steal' a musical instrument - the start of a 0</p>
<p>Tx and tc.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>% symbol - growth/division....a natural phenomena - single cell and all</p>
<p>hack - make it a 'tool' via $ subservience...</p>
<p>symbolism - the master really did a good job in appropriating symbols to their ways...</p>
<p>% symbol - is really the decider in alfreds world - growth - professional/personal : all quantified via % - roi etc...
