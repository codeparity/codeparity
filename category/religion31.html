<p>I wont describe it, just put it in contrast to 'logic' of policy making...</p>
<p>if something is true for n=0, n=1, N, N+1 - something real programmers (C/C++...) really use to scope out the perf of their programs</p>

<p>XGenderism</p>
<p>Feelings=rights of 'few' should matter more than lives of 'natives'/others...</p>
<p>Masters - they hacked feelings to reboot the matrix....</p>

                <p>Delusions, beliefs and perception = truth</p>
<p>this is a personal discovery - walking and hacking the fine lines...</p>
<p>the most prevalent and genius iq hack for ppl is to paint their 'targets' as - hackable or hacked = capability / intellect / intents</p>
<p>the ultimate hack = delusional</p>
<p>the times we live in, logical arguments and even words, seem to 'hurt'</p>
<p>so feelings - are often prioritized</p>
<p>matrix - the 4th one....the lizards did make this point - they shifted a binary matrix to 'feelings' based - grey 1 - everyone thinks 'guilt' yet capitalism/time must flow...</p>

<p>booglie/personal recap of side effects of 0</p>
<p>ppl show themselves - they put in their final verdict...</p>
<p>for me, it was 'delusional/disturbed'</p>
<p>it flew...</p>
<p>i was 0...so i dint know....i felt...but debugging is about being sure.</p>
<p>0 became 0--, as ppl-=ppl loop continued...</p>
<p>0...has a weird power...to see from a 0....the opportunities...appear.</p>
<p>they are different from your perception of being N</p>
<p>=&gt;logically, one becomes 0 from N...so definitely perception/opportunities are different.</p>
<p>they change as 'intents' show themselves...</p>
<p>thats the real investment of time, life....</p>
<p>ideas, viability on / of ppl...will keep on evolving...</p>
<p>the key is patience/time - life of 0</p>
<p>faith/belief/religion - whatever 1's true 0 is ...remains with them</p>
<p>and then ...power of 0</p>
<p>its awesome coz - its u.</p>

<p>made money, but not free - hence u bear my 'genius' backbencher gyaan - all unapproved - forbidden fruit kinds.. üòÇ </p>
