<p>now,</p>
<p>future</p>
<p>and history, science at all - only to establish or unestablish a path - whether it works, or is just a fantasy - history and all - known, observable 1</p>
<p>too abstract - i get it...</p>
<p>it goes like this...</p>
<p>now - if $$ is the issue (it would be - $ is the unsaid religion)</p>
<p>really consider the credit and debit - how they have changed over years - as you got income/age++</p>
<p>the best 0 to compute is bachelor days - the brief period - if any ...when 1 had more $$ than to spend</p>
<p>thats you 'good' 0</p>
<p>then now - the cars, the properties, the emis, or returns - their time value and variance...</p>
<p>the difficult part - the feelings which these 'debts' or assumed 'investments' cause you - things - easy</p>
<p>ppl - v v difficult...</p>
<p>time is the real $$, the money $$ is an illusion - which makes your 0++ - habitus and their 'emotional' expectations</p>
<p>=&gt; your time and its value = the lowest time returns  - yet dependents </p>
<p>some duties, most just emotional debts - the proverbial cockroach jar - which keeps moving in rhythm with "trends" - cool cars, homes, tech - to establish </p>
<p>$$ superiority in order of alfreds.</p>
<p>thats how 1 really knows - what he wants - get skilled++ = ai, tools, tech - all free, all available for anyone..</p>
<p>but then, the real hack is 'looking good', make it till u fake it and all - suckers work, smart ppl earn - the hidden msg in all the stevie jovs, mukerzerx and now - muskie and faultman...</p>
<p>cant fix a tyre - yet 'kings' of their ponds of glory - the title and all..always afraid of not being the psy/op the superman title does to ego - for spouse, kid - etc...not worth it -imho </p>
<p>your 0 - is different from mine</p>
<p>my wants are as unique as my origin story - hence my actions.</p>
<p>a 0 - is knowing this for sure.</p>
<p>$$ money is a tool - can be 'hacked'/borrowed - if u get 'good'</p>
<p>metaverse is really needed for some ppl - wont do well in real 1 ðŸ˜‚ </p>

<p>the reason i say $ is the real religion...is simply that most religions require some clothes, some things - festivals and all to really abide and receive blessings - the psy/op of being an eternal sinner/always owed gratitude and all - morality of it</p>
<p>religion of codeparity doesnt require anything - a 0 - just the true cost and money of life - time</p>
<p>the most you know u - the more conscious 1 can be in spending his $$</p>
<p>we live in a world where 'geniuses' are millionaires - skill / passion and all</p>
<p>different programs should produce different outputs to same habitus</p>
<p>but bricks - they are same ... they have to be...the are needed to build empires.</p>

<p>the most logical argument to muskie huskie billie - tech god gang is simple..</p>
<p>plug yourselves in - do all the good in the metaverse - shoot yourselves into space - self protection, eat zee bugs - self sustainable and all - report back if it works - we can survive nature - all of us have - 2k years..</p>
<p>dont worry about X / twatter - world worked better before them - launch zee missiles was better than release the immigrants...</p>

<p>The delhi i grew up had a weird culture - every sunday, every unkle would take out his car, scooter etc - to give it a weekly routine</p>
<p>it was socializing, maintenance, sunbathing, exchange of tools - knowledge </p>
<ul>
<li>everything logical - there was not internet then</li>
</ul>
<p>it created an ecosystem in itself - tools, knowledge, innovation was often done in these 'money minded' yet social indian bunch - the good of capitalism</p>
<p>same can be said about week day/end markets - they are not just bargain spree now - money and food affordability has been been organically maintained due to culture and practicality of it</p>
<p>all that blah - just to underline a basic perspective of luxury vs dependence</p>
<p>a neighborhood where no one knows how to jack a car when its really needed</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>a an aggregator app which provides few hours of operation, but gives a plastic shiny card?</p>

<p>One of the weird yet illogical things done in India - $ capitalism is to put 10/15 years on 'longevity' of their cars</p>
<p>who would maintain their vehicles - they have a depreciating $$ attached to it</p>
<p>it is "indian" done wrong - there should be no logical debate about this - govt using ppl and vehicles as cash cows - fines, maintenance, pollution certs yet - no logical sense of it all - other than ppl forced to 'disown' their cars - the paperwork in vintage and all  is all bakwaas when all is needed/wanted is pollution certs.</p>

<p>whatever has been described, is painfully coming true - and i would have rather loved isolation and irrelevance than becoming ' a told u so guy'</p>

                <p>Improvement - Power of 0, religion of CodeParity etc</p>
<p>it is really easy to improve over a 0</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is natural</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>earth/mother supports it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sun/father helps you heal it - stability, adherence, pure will of giving - selflessly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The real issue with gurus/self help genre is simple - they establish a N for a 0...in a time series universe...</p>
<p>time, days, dates, months - all are % bound tools - which may lure/serpent with a quick fix - emotional, material, avoidance and all...</p>
<p>but it is always a pattern - a recursive 1 - of feelings, money - ppl or $ to earn that 0 of feeling - your happy.</p>
<p>Born unique - to unique parents, lineage, land, circumstances - stack</p>
<p>share common needs, memory - box, habitus, ram, bios</p>
<p>yet - a brick of a sheep, rebooted every month to feel good- a win, no matter what the karma - a win is needed.</p>
<p>This is all the self help anyone needs - ask hard question when 'time' is right.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use comments to address the invisible g_baldies, tech_cheetahs, pappus and all - just to let them know that all the hired "spies" - real ones - v v real - following, attempts to confront and all...</p>
<p>they all failed - cox baby - i am really healed and me - someone born to be a 0, yet some force pushes me up - it is just me recognizing that gratitude and force by action...and it really is a balance of gratitude - in skill, in 'force' - a belief, skills are always there in a tech world - time and will.</p>

<p>On sounding preachy - i am really trying hard not to...but some things need to be said as they deserve.</p>

<p>"Riding a high horse" - as brit master may say. The difference is - it is my horse, and i ride it - you watch it - sheep.</p>
