<p>skills</p>
<p>bs skills</p>
<p>skills - all primitive, all materialistic/nihilistic - maaya/the borne out of Imagination - $</p>
<p>Skills which we - consciously or un consciously value in kids/aka future = us</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>intelligence - maths, physics etc - logic - alfreds' way of life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>feelings - looks, arts, music etc - feelings - abduls' way of life</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In true nihilism - both are equally important </p>
<ul>
<li>ultimately everything converges into a feeling</li>
</ul>
<p>society approved, unapproved - depends on "society - the collection of sheep which really raised these alfreds and abduls"</p>
<p>Alfreds - claim to "create"</p>
<p>Abduls - demonized to "destroy"</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>all of this was good and fine - if it was leading to "elevation"/"true progress"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of physicality or of intellect...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>but really - the rothies, the shwabs, the wef - pretty poodle grooming club...can they really boast of any elevation? just "pure" of "blood" and in familia honka donkas..</p>
<p>Just the same old reboot of "money".</p>

<p>Oh how i wish i was the one reading this blah blah...and the "writer"</p>
<p>i hope there was a "better" person than me .... writing all this...</p>
<p>but you have to realize the "irony" of it - once you realize all this blah blah....the logical place for you to be is somewhere - where you realize that - i dont really care ... and i really dont</p>
<p>the kid - the dogs - the ones who bear the consequences of "religion" of these abduls and alfreds - they all are bullies - end up hurting the vulnerable - the ones who cant speak - kids or dogs/animals..</p>
<p>thats why i just cant keep quite - need to scale up the "unveiling"</p>

<p>kids/aka future = us</p>
<p>is a good way to take the self bias out of your perspective</p>
<p>no matter what life means - the part any parent teaches his kid - is really the true 'bios' we impart in our kids - who really know all there is to know - green: good, red bad</p>
<p>crying - bad</p>
<p>thats it - they can take it from there</p>

                <p>The "Key"</p>
<p>To debug yourself:</p>
<p>Understand and quantify the "emotion"</p>
<p>eg - right now </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why this guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does he ever work...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the emotion - curiosity, hate, lurv etc</p>
<p>and i am all those things 😀 </p>
<ul>
<li>but lets make it about "debugging"</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did 1 feels that - the reason and logic is the key</p>
<p>the thought process goes like this</p>
<p>hate</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i hate his face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate cox a 0 cannot be "right" - brand always is "company, religion, leader etc"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate the "disrespectful-ness"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to sum it up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pause, take a breath</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask the "why"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>see - no going to a "quiet" place or "being holy" and all -effienet and hacky as you would like it - engages - the Neo brain (conscious thinking) over impulse.</p>
<p>As an engineer - understanding "why" - to the level of perception i have - was satisfying.</p>
<p>The logic "whys" - the layers to which 1 can debug himselves - the bigger Neo he becomes (Neo-cortex) something which evolves vs the very physical, literal lizard brain we all have.....</p>
<p>//he is delusional , still why i am i reading this??</p>
<p>// ask the "why"</p>

<p>I ll give a g_baldie_1 and general g_baldies[] example</p>
<p>to "solve" for g_baldies[]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>understand the "why"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observe the "why" - as time goes - deltas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observe the change in "whys"</p>

<p>the answer in low iq $ world - is just $ </p>
<p>then what they do with it </p>
<p>g_baldies[] buy teslas 😁 </p>
<p>their glasses really go "golden"</p>
<p>the tone - authoritative</p>
<p>logic - non explainable - just ppl and their past "high scores"</p>
<p>then - go hack - at any layer</p>
<p>i ll use the $ game and its "knowledge" </p>
<p>what ppl do with it...</p>
<p>sometimes, it is just sad - a g_baldie_1 craving for fame, emotion - never had in school, college, pro_life - ever</p>
<p>now - u got "nice" women - going all 😂 😂 </p>
<p>and aww - the 1" intellectual thing - the rockstar / pink floydm  logging it out - corp version of "angst" - highs, which may be "unconquered" if humble leaders like us, dont make time to play "Comfortably numb" - at 6:00 PM - friday evening </p>

<p>Sometimes - atleast for me - there was a time - 10-13 years ago...when the "why"s stopped calming me down</p>
<p>that was the time - the doc was really needed - the rage was just whack - autoimmune disease - in a different form</p>
<p>an unsolved nutritional/cultural "why" which the doctors, leaders of the world - never debugged, just accepted.</p>

<li>i dint.</li>

<p>took "hate" as example - a general observation on "likeys" vs reads</p>
<p>nihilism - the roots of codeparity are in reality - not in some philosophical or real creature</p>

<p>I ll call it "religion" because "religion" is essentially a social protocol which establishes "trust" between people.</p>
<p>The beliefs of this religion would override each and every piece of habitus values any employee may imbibe (economic, religious, abilities, appearance - quantified equality)</p>
<p>And i will quantify them - as i build and commercialize "paw" - open source, self maintainable - build by people with "values".</p>
<p>Merit based on values. </p>

<p>Give 2000 years - enough debauchery, enough time to make the whole world a mixed gene pool...</p>
<p>Evolution - more like "solve et coagula" at work - a superior force would emerge</p>
<p>The RH- bloodline - the assumed royal ones - they think they are smart enough to stop a natural force - earth (mother), sun(father) - vax, artificial food, uv rays - absolute targeted and intended destruction to cement earthly gods and their lineage on "pure"</p>
<p>Pure = in breeding.

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>logic of all of this</p>
<p>I ve seen "good" people choosing silence/inaction due to repercussions of speaking out - money, in many forms</p>
<p>The reason i shared my origins - for most of my life, i was made to believe that what my grandad did - was not necessary and evil</p>
<p>Ppl were divided - no one dared asked my Grandad, but judgements were made</p>
<p>Those judgements influenced a lot of ppl - me too</p>
<p>I chose way of my father - education - whatever drew my interest</p>
<p>I saw a division of an idea of "Hindu/Indian" - which had extreme bearing on me</p>
<p>We are reliving the same choice - all of us</p>
<p>Option - this wont and cant happen</p>
<p>I have seen stories, things which i was told to be not proud of...but then, education and morales - they dont seem to apply to green ppl - just the taxpayers - the ppl who slog it out to provide for..</p>
<p>yet, just a sheep </p>
<ul>
<li>money and its value is too apparent to - ppl in kashmir, now israel and some alive ancestors in Delhi too </li>
</ul>
<p>Our former PM (Pv Narasimha Rao) made a very beautiful statement - not making a decision is also making a decision</p>
<p>conversely - not speaking out is also a decision.</p>
<p>silence only emboldens the bully - a former bully knows.</p>

<p>I like them.</p>
<p>I am onboard too</p>
<p>"selection" of ppl, all this might qualify me above "alfreds" 😀</p>
<p>naah - alfreds would boot me out from masters' ship...the are good at polishing knobs - safer for them, skilled too</p>
<p>I tend to go "bitey" - stray and all...and i have a "paw" too...🤔</p>
