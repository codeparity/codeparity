<p>may "expire" if not used - is important </p>
<p>gold/cash allowed you to disconnect from the system - choice</p>
<p>this wont</p>
<p>it is politics, religion, wish of masters - all combined into 1 superpower -money</p>
<p>Masters also seek optimization over sheep</p>
<p>-this "alleged depopulation" - allow ppl do stuff to each other, import neanderthals - raise the % - engineer a clash</p>
<p>whatever remains - eternally grateful sheep - a better palpable version of the neandethals - they took too much mental bandwidth
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blackrock - wont go bankrupt, exactly because of this reason.</p>
<p>If one "influences" the rules, under no "governance", then it also owns the thing we call "money"</p>
<p>Hope the picture is clear - the .1 % elites wont even have to say sorry - the judiciary, the "watchdog poodles" ... no consequences for them - just the sheep</p>
<p>It doesnt mean things would get cheaper, on the contrary - things would get expensive for $ countries - they really dont produce anything apart from their "entitlements" under Intellectual Property</p>
<p>So fake food, eat zee bugs, be happy - take a pill/fentanyl</p>
<p>You would be - since outside the 15 min cities, ppl are just wild child killers/etc...</p>
<p>It doesnt get clearer than this - this is what would happen if everyone remains "nice" üôè </p>

                <p>It seems about the kids </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1 book creates neanderthals in middle ease </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>US/world lawmakers, Tech Gods are also "interested" - funding both hamas and Palestine - apparently </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The "progressive" people(big tech)  are all for it </p>
<ul>
<li>California and its residents "like" 12 year old kids taking life altering decisions : https://lnkd.in/dJ6AhctV</li>
</ul>
<p>Some existing laws</p>
<p>-AB 957 : Punishes parents who don‚Äôt ‚Äúaffirm‚Äù their child‚Äôs trans identity</p>
<p>-SB 107: Removes an out-of-state child from their parents if the child travels to California to obtain gender transition procedures</p>
<p>-SB 145: Reduced penalty for offenders who sodomize chiIdren as young as 14</p>
<p>-SB 866: Allows kids to consent to medical decisions without parental knowledge</p>
<ul>
<li>SB 132: Requires prisons to put males in female prisons if they claim to feel like a woman</li>
</ul>
<p>The above 'laws' might well be written in arabic or urdu - would make much sense</p>
<p>Education is being "updated" to catch us up : https://lnkd.in/dMrvTX2i</p>
<p>If $ can be considered a man made thing... what can one call this "fascination" with other people's kids???</p>
<p>To me, money is just the "razmatazz" which hides the very underbelly of "capitalism" and its illogical implementation - a very primeval, neanderthal control - religion created to make 'ancient, mindless weapons"</p>
<p>It works</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to keep masses under control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programmed for a crash, if allowed to go on - masters are always needed with wisdom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a virus which feeds on an organism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a "genius" virus that doesnt realize - life of organism is essential for virus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no logical explanation of  feeding "a religion" - recursive, non intelligent algorithm </p>
<p>The followers are part of the control, a very "genius" and ancient one </p>
<ul>
<li>smart people ask for money, these ones do it for free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Money changing hands, people struggling to maintain lifestyle, but somehow the neanderthals in middle east get guns, food, electric, internet and all the things which they dint and cant invent - handed to them</p>
<p>Genius?</p>
<p>Planned?</p>
<p>Let down by "genius parents"?</p>
<p>How can it be explained to the slain kids </p>
<ul>
<li>they wont know how the 'leaders' and the 'sheep' let them down in different ways</li>
</ul>
<p>duty</p>
<p>purpose</p>
<p>awareness</p>
<p>progress</p>
<p>they have a  metaverse - it happens anyway - reboot it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Binary search in "setting expectation"</p>
<p>"News" or the "feelings" conveyed by it - can be disturbing and moving</p>
<p>One of the patterns of masters - is using "binary search" in reverse - to find or set the social / moral compass</p>
<p>Neanderthals were always neanderthals - they might think of themselves as "khalifa" and all, they are the pointer of "low expectations of society" - used by brit masters</p>
<p>Terrorism, "Un-ignorable acts of violence" etc - something to go to war to</p>
<p>They always happened - kashmir, pakistan, bangladesh - internal to - courtesy "genius" "tech wizard" home minister and his "genius" team</p>
<p>but now it serves a purpose - to play the final hand for $$ - the need which cannot be ignored - war - missiles etc</p>
<p>West - high pointer</p>
<p>Middle east - low pointer</p>
<p>we - the 99% in between - making choices, but choosing is irrelevant</p>

<p>it is not a 'joke'</p>
<p>i was borne and brought up in "chirag dilli" - the name might give an indication of 'the history/lineage' of the place</p>
<p>the 'news'/'videos' coming out of Israel - are still 'moderate'</p>
<p>My grandad - became 'sarpanch/leader' of the village - because he knew 'how to handle' the green ones.</p>
<p>he was good at it - unanimously elected the 'leader' till his last days</p>
<p>My father knew the change in 'times' =&gt; post 1960s</p>
<p>Grandad's "bravery" - had real economic/social costs - education and compliance was the way to go</p>
<p>I was confused - i did not know what to believe in.</p>
<p>Israel is my confirmation - it is logical, coz the book hasnt changed or the madarssa.</p>
<p>Police, law - are retrospective measures - it wont be wise to depend on them</p>
<p>Prep is better than cure.</p>
<p>Lighter, cheap deo = awesome portable flamethrower.</p>
<p>Keep dogs.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant.</p>
<p>Tc and be safe.</p>
