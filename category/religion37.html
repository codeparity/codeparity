<p>should be part of base education - helps in discovery of "you"</p>
<p>This is about "hacking" from outside. </p>
<p>What if these ppl were the "insiders"?</p>
<p>will they hire to carry on "white collar crimes" or grey corp/capitalistic espionage ?</p>
<p>I think they do, it explains why they will hire "baldies" with "decades" old experience - the "data" is the gold.</p>

<p>the cloud game - full of out of date baldies - who sold "boxes"</p>
<p>suddenly they are needed at "cloud leadership"</p>
<p>none of these guys can really explain cloud to a newbie engineer - they never used it - only preach it.</p>
<p>the pnb thing - hiring of the orakle leadership - was due to their in-prem deployment. GOI forbade cloud in banking long ago - still "detailed account plans" are needed by baldie alfred</p>
<p>i dont think even he knew- he was busy chasing his "golden" bone out of country which treated his as per his "aukaat"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cloud is a "apps" thing - roi/risk is manageable</p>
<p>the "enterprise" part - someone running those servers at superior bandwith, with less cost (discounts etc)</p>
<p>sometimes the discounts wont even justify the "electric cost"</p>
<p>but, they are offered = "strategically"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I dint learn it on purpose - i was on "receiving" end of it.</p>
<p>Always trying to "reverse engineer" - I dint react as i was expected to....initially i did, but you learn</p>
<p>it becomes increasingly evident - the internal "broadcast messaging" - they things, portfolios, the kind of companies/assets they are after....telecom/banking are the "highest" priority, then the nihilistic layers - water, land, agri, electric - whatever the host govt would "allow" them to do</p>
<p>colorado usa - they destroyed a whole city, a river with countless animals to set up the "cloud farms"</p>
<p>yet, the 'news' is their 'fren' so you ll never hear it</p>
<p>just how "big tech" cares - planted trees, green campus and glory...</p>

<p>It is only going to get increasingly evident - how valuable software engineering as a sole skill is.</p>
<p>I wrote about it some time back - https://lnkd.in/deSBx4ej</p>
<p>The real intent of this post is to share a public mark - for the stray brotherhood</p>
<p>Sold the measly alphabet stock </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is not much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>money is an approximation of value, value which is in the hand of the holder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a true testament of the "merit" of the holder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right now - the way things are stacked, it is really a 0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will use this and only this measly sum to take over alfreds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Delusional - I hear you. Quite accustomed to it - it is boring for me now....</p>
<p>My take on nihilism applies to me too - challenges need to rise with "perceived maturity" (https://lnkd.in/dtsiPgfB)</p>
<p>this week may mark the "change" in status - quo - peak of the "$$ magic"</p>
<p>Lets take it to streets now - and make something truly remarkable - something which lays and exemplifies "CodeParity Values" - self maintainable, open source.</p>
<p>Will continue make a joke of 2 - on alfreds and brit masters....our paths will coincide when we start experimenting with "energy stuff"</p>
<p>PS :Looking for collaboration with PCB manufacturers </p>
<p>If you know 1 ( would prefer Indian - money flow/capitalism reasons, please ask them to get in touch with ashish@codeparity.com</p>

<p>"inspire" is what 1 can ever achieve to do - every one of us needs and aims to - just making the story public to make it fun.</p>
<p>I paid my respects - now making something of that - hoping that someone chooses to not become an "alfred".</p>
<p>Not just cox it is the "right" thing to do - it is also "fun" thing to do.</p>
<p>bullies behind closed doors - they dint see a bully who reformed.</p>
<p>it will be much fun, if it wasnt already.</p>

<p>Those mitesh, bajwas and other sideys - lets see who holds more "value" after some time.. making this public - the sheer nepotism and base animalistic mannerism  - none of you deserve any "sheen" even in closed circles.</p>
<p>I really learnt from brit masters - the patterns in CS/design - how to "solve"</p>
<p>Though i will solve for me, and something i am really passionate about - u ll see how it solves for the "alfreds" </p>
<p>if it is not evident now, it is going to become v v evident soon 😉 </p>
