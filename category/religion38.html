                <p>The proof is in actions - not words</p>
<p>In a fair world - A non AI version of tesla - it would make sense - practical as well as capitalistic</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>longer lasting "non polluting" cars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people can "innovate" when a car is deemed unworthy - swap in lipo for ...lets say a hydrogen generator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would make the "deal" cleaner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sustainable, reaching where there is no cell connectivity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It wont ever happen - The glory of resurrecting a decades old concept with the razzmatazz of real life iron man - people are virtually in love with these "voluntary sign-offs of their will" - so called modern life, to become modern sheep</p>
<p>it is the iphone story all over again - people craving for society approval and endorsing a company which makes "no bones" about creating a "closed ecosystem"</p>
<p>the closed ecosystem leads to 15 minute cities - at mercy of ppl who make "no bones" about their "intents" - and hey, i absolutely believe in their book - history is totally spot on - you got to admire the simplicity of algorithm.</p>
<p>so the green ppl create fear, the messiahs solve for fear - using tech</p>
<p>this all leads to a good world - where anyone can be anyone in metaverse</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>which feels silly coz of zuki's apparent genius</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would feel awesome when muskie plugs in the neuralink</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>....all the world is sorted ...the "feeling" is the ultimate hack - and muskie is on target to hit that</p>
<p>i like my real dopamine, not a video game, cgi induced "kick" which some rich billionaire delegates an ai to scale.</p>
<p>nueralink is the literal "matrix" connector - we are the generation which plugs itself in.</p>

<p>6.5 inches+  screens - tablets were those size</p>
<p>someone decided that phones are to be used for "video" consumption - the educative kinds or work...it is the illusion...net result is the "black mirror" (awesome series)</p>
<p>this choice means that you literally have to carry this divide to even listen to music.</p>
<p>apple jobs was a real psy hacker - calligraphy, music - he hacked "feelings" first</p>
<p>online only content is the lure which starts it, music libraries, itunes, cloud, convenience, the availability of it, reliability .... all to replace the rs 30 cd in friday market...</p>
<p>their ideas wont ever make sense here....i am just spelling them out...its fun.</p>

<p>like a casino - the illision of a win or the thrill of it...</p>
<p>startups - the illusion of success is what keeps this "prototype" alive</p>
<p>a guy with so much superiority to produce 9+ kids ....</p>
<p>it means he thinks his kind is "needed"</p>
<p>assured of "money" and its value - as if he knows the game...</p>
<p>capitalism has perverted that "innovation" to spread itself....the best example is bitcoin - unknown origins - hailed as a virtual messiah in crypto world</p>
<p>it simply was a test of times to come...and people chose it over religion - hardware, electricity, internet, money - all to lay ground to create an absolutely loyal following of souls - a new digital religion</p>
<p>like real estate or anything really - "value" can be an illusion and there cannot be a bigger example</p>
<p>those rigs...the valuation of ai hw and sw industry..it is all seems like an illusion - a choice made by each of us everyday for dependence on these entities - the tech gods or the stock gods - the enterprises</p>
<p>i am not about stopping it or even resisting it...in fact...we ll make money from it</p>
<p>the signup - users choice.

<p>wef plants the happy version of an idea, blackrubble, asguards of the world fund it, a grade wef proginy like these "geniuses" get those grants to buy the tech, buy press to win mass approval. shares/stocks follow these mass "feelings" and a failed (dirty/unsustainable/dangerous) tech like lipo becomes "value"</p>
<p>magnetism, induction...as old as modern capitalism itself...yet no breakthroughs even after invention of computers</p>
<p>more diseases than cures - seems like windows.</p>
<p>money is not fake now, not for a "lot" of us.</p>

<p>in the neighbourhood that formed my base layer - values....a stranger trying to offer candy to a kid was rarely spotted again</p>
<p>it wasnt a relative or a cop...everyone looked after everyone...electricity wasnt reliable as the people</p>
<p>now. the rich pedos can convince people that their kids can be taught touched by pedo teacher - they call it progress</p>
<p>it gets "likes" cox the guy saying it has money</p>
<p>do i need these people - for anything? fun, learning or just for recognition??</p>
<p>naah...most of them call me to get guidance for working for pedos...even former "mentors"</p>
<p>??</p>

<p>my predecessors - optimistic/brave/unknown ....they trusted society too much ...</p>
<p>i dont share that optimism... time needs to be respected,</p>
<p>it in turn means being patient, watch the true religion - money, and its effects on various people </p>
<p>money - has different forms - influence, relative/perceived beautify and the mass truth/hysteria/hopium ppl are wishing for...</p>
<p>to defeat this matrix...one has to truly win on these individual matrices..financial, spiritual and material....</p>
<p>as i tried sharing earlier - hacking is an art, which is much older than computers.</p>
<p>a good hackers knows the layers and the entry/exchange point of protocols between these layers.</p>
<p>brit masters - learn from them - a true homage to a master, yet a true test of evolution </p>
<p>Akuma's birth - goki was happy in his final moments - his success was his pupil's success - a true test...a conclusion of a successful life.</p>
<p>Akuma, like money is not evil or good - it just serves a purpose. </p>

<p>I am not a religious guy.. for me - Sanatan or base Hinduism is actually living logically or aesthetically</p>
<p>No religion is really "sanatan".</p>
<p>The caste/division thing is a nepotistic pattern - inbuilt into any parent - to make sure their kids have a better chance</p>
<p>it is really a perspective build on illusion of "scarcity"...</p>
<p>and if you really look into past 10-15 years...- the world has been food sufficient - only to be constrained by fake $ and the "generosities" of billionaires</p>
<p>the rulers need a divide - and they had and used many - color, creed, religion, nationality etc.... </p>
<p>fun fact - passports were an invention of "world wars" - which one may argue - were directly or indirectly fuelled and needled by all knowing masters in london - following vatican.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The canada thing - should be the confirmation of the unfortunate, illogical, invisible, yet very real "war" we are part of</p>
<p>a side which wants to claim humanity hacking its nihilistic/animistic tendencies - coz morality is so out of fashion...ai, lowering age of consent etc is the way to go...</p>
<p>the other side...which has always been defending with "jugaad" - survival with whatever gratitude one can offer</p>
<p>the war which largely people of the world are blind to...and thats is the real reason unique cultures are a threat to '15 min cities"/universal capitalistic harmony/safe/provided for/free money and hence - freedom</p>
<p>we are in a war - and it is sort of biblical... i dont think many people are aware of it...hence this.</p>

                <p>The Brit masters way of justice is clever and deceiving in illogical way - it does not recognize the value of time - justice or even complaints stretch to years</p>
<p>If one wants to quantify the value of his time - its is quite easy </p>
<p>Monthly Salary / 30</p>
<p>thats what really my 24 hours are worth - no matter which fruity story the people in "human resources" had me believe.</p>
<p>This money decides the "ability to get justice" - hire the top lawyer or other measures - it is really a perspective</p>
<p>A flawed justice system, with self appointed judges - worldwide</p>
<p>we were in 1 world govt already - now better "efficiency" is expected.</p>
<p>So here comes the new online safety bill - now govt can snoop legally to "determine" if you were being "unsafe"!!</p>
<p>keep ppl locked up inside - and they will do what they really are told not to </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lets follow the timeline here</p>
<p>once upon a time, Vatican made its mission to spread religion to the globe</p>
<p>it largely succeeded </p>
<p>the ppl in hollywood decide -" religion is so 70s" (just after gold standard was abolished")</p>
<p>for the 1st time - the church is OK with all the computer revolution and the free educative videos out there...</p>
<p>then the universal basics of morality - the 7 sins were phased out and made fun of</p>
<p>now - with vax, tax and unemployment - it is quite predictable - ppl wont even be able to speak their mind online - leave apart the real world where ppl already live for society approval with loans and cars of "amazing" value.</p>
<p>ppl with pent up anger and anxiety: with no way of dealing with it....fentnyl makes sense now - this is not at all predictable</p>
<p>i think masters planned this all along - we trust them too much!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"baps" lies in details....</p>
<p>the law enables the govt to slap a label on anyone - adversely affecting their social/mental state as well as ability to make money - at employment or business - perspectives are the real laws</p>
<p>if credit_score_check(android_like_resource) &gt;=PASS || social_score_check(android_like_resource, X, LINKED, FB etc == WOKE)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>print("Loan/Employment Approved")</p>
<p>//....other bs pattern...</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Equality and Inclusivity delivered!!</p>
<p>Yay DEI!!!</p>
