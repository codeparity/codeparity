<p>Time is kind of important here - vax is alleged to have 1st practical use of another tech suppressed - the "nanotech" (graphene particles)</p>
<p>remember those fruity "nano layer coated" sanitary ware ads on linkedin/yt - the ones which promised always "clean" toilets and all</p>
<p>The bayers of the world - manufacturer of most toxic stuff (search agent yellow) on earth cant let go of a staple which keeps them running.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Stars are shining, stocks are up - world is singing to your tune</p>
<p>Rejoice, for humanity has birthed its tech "savior"</p>
<p>....this was few years back</p>
<p>then, it became about freedom and claiming it back</p>
<p>....dems/libs are out of control - he says</p>
<p>It is harvest time now, so forget all that</p>
<p>...now attach your biometrics to get a 160 character, "free" voice - so fair!!</p>
<p>summarizing the context:</p>
<p>twitter was about communication - it served a purpose of worldwide "broadcast"</p>
<p>conspiracy ppl call it propoganda - "virality"/"the sob stories", "the proud moments", etc-  ( recommendations blah blah algos which every "big tech" engg crams up, only to never use 😎 ) </p>
<ul>
<li>talk to a real engg, and he will tell you how financially "insane" a M+ fanout global model looks like - it was never financially viable - based on "fanout" alone</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;It served a global purpose of global sync of ppl. </p>
<p>eg farmer agitations in India getting morality lectures from PMs who cancelled bank accounts of their "dissenting" citizens</p>
<p>Now money is not money- but a token.</p>
<p>a token which may allow you to tweet, communicate with "rightly suggested" people (based on location, occupation, pay - sheep stable etc)</p>
<p>X is about global money, it makes sense too</p>
<p>=ai to "generate content", neuralink to "conjure" the content on fly..., tesla to take you around (till its "safe")...and X to do "everything"</p>
<p>WEF likey global money, global society, no religion, no diversity.</p>
<p>-just diversity in the "kind" of people, </p>
<p>NOT</p>
<p>in what they consume.</p>
<p>or read</p>
<p>or believe</p>
<p>or eat</p>
<p>or think</p>
<ul>
<li>just few saviors, who were there in time, to do the right things, when "people" needed them</li>
</ul>
<p>What option do we have - worldcoin seems evil, so go with muskie!!!</p>
<p>A pattern -  like last 100 years of west - create 2 divides, both do the same, but speak in different dialects.</p>
<p>Overplayed? No, i think there is still a lot of "trust" left....</p>

<p>Religious ppl have a specific name in the Bible - the deceiver, false light prophet etc...</p>
<p>but we are logic ppl .... we play by "science"</p>
<p>when muskie dresses up as baphomet, as "a joke" .... it is still "science"?? or "cool"</p>
<p>there seem to be a sacred law - they never lie, only deceive/divert</p>
<p>I am just stumped by how accurate some of the depictions are .... and how eroded the faith of a normal human is - in any of the religions - convenient to knit-pick without adhering to the values any of them prescribes.

                <p>Rx - a symbol mostly popular for use in medical prescriptions has as lot more going for it</p>
<p>-It may mean a controlled or prescribed burn (RX) in context of "fires"</p>
<p>-In "genetics", it is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RAX gene.The RAX gene is located on chromosome 18 in humans, mice, and rats.</p>
<p>there seems to be an awkward relevance to these "less known" interpretations to this symbol</p>
<p>The wikipedia entry seems "suggestive"</p>
<p>".</p>
<p>Controlled burns on Australian savannas can result in an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring "strategic fire management across 28,000 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi) of Western Arnhem Land" to partially offset greenhouse gas emissions from a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin, Australia.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>the other one - 'genetics' related .... is being pushed in our lives by "prescriptions" and "subscriptions" - viruses, flues, vax etc</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dfMHYiTH</p>
<p>symbols seem important - they do have a story to tell, and it may turn out to be an important story to know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Symbols seem like an "exchange" of sorts</p>
<p>people invest in it, masses trust it - it makes money flow in a practical/capitalistic world</p>
<p>the choice of symbols is curious - reptoid symbols stand out - medical, $ money, doctor etc</p>
<p>it is a purest "investment" in a capitalistic world - the word of snake - the demiurge of the world - recognizing and pledging your allegiance - soul and material</p>
<p>it delivers too...but it doesnt "evolve"</p>
<p>evolution can be different from what we perceive. The vedas dint write themselves, and the "dark ages" might really be the "light ages"</p>
<p>The pyramids, the left over temples in south - are impossible to build even today</p>
<p>dark ages?? 😀 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The X in new twatter is curious, isnt it?</p>
<p>the makhichoos paid so much money for it.....a "brand" was destroyed...</p>
<p>it must mean something significant, important.</p>
<p>There is some incentive for people to force these symbols on us.</p>
<p>it is costly, ugly and defies capitalism</p>
<p>still, it flew</p>
<p>Inversion of symbols is a common concept. Swastika still being inverted and appropriated by west as 'Hakenkreuz' is the most prominent example of a religion/tribe being psychologically brainwashed into not using it</p>
<p>it inverted form - 'Hakenkreuz' still is defined as "swastika" in all white/master/genius ppl literature</p>
<p>who cares about correcting them ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X - It seems like an inverted cross to me, but why should i care....the people who "invest" in this symbol in its non inverted form seem to forget what it represents...a union of horizontal and the vertical</p>
<p>a sort of balance between what can be characterized as feminine/adaptability/humility - the horizontal and the strength of a vertical structure - typically classified as masculine</p>
<p>=&gt; now being reduced as a union of none - a single entity which is all consuming, all powerful</p>
<p>there is not much to symbols, it is intuitive if you "constellate" correctly - as the unknown prophet says and guides</p>

                <p>Delusional +++ take</p>
<p>revisit last few years, specifically after 2019</p>
<p>a virus is released</p>
<p>govts/corps of the world dole out free money</p>
<p>people get detached - illusion of climbing a stair in maslow's hierarchy of needs</p>
<p>most splurge - cars, investments etc - assured of the way they are - well taken care off</p>
<p>In last year itself - the veil is becoming thinner by the day - held by some artificial, yet invisible force</p>
<p>It can be a natural disaster, or a war - to force a change in habits</p>
<p>Watchmen shows what "heroes" do, to unite the lesser folk.</p>
<p>This orb/worldcoin/retinal scan thing - it is the decider - the choice.</p>
<p>They will psy op teens into it - snap chit, twatter, other stuff i am not even aware off - would make this sound hip/cool/futuristic</p>
<p>-they will do real good too - like bigtech once did</p>
<p>-the trust or the need - whatever gives in first!!</p>
<p>Local govts losing control of eco, law</p>
<p>Inflation - natural or induced or psuedo natural - doesnt really matter</p>
<p>Natural disasters - with local telecoms failing =&gt; starlink - ironman coming to rescue</p>
<p>"earth" is getting hotter - it should and it must - wef says so</p>
<p>haarp is imaginary, so is cloud seeding...</p>
<p>sleep easy - it is all going to roll over....state would take care of it.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joker doesnt even remember his tragedy...his whole shtick is to really unscrew batman....to break him as a hobby...he seems to have the ability - intellectual as well as physical...resource rich despite - no money or even "purpose"</p>
<p>not really cox he wants to, or needs to...it is just that he is "free" to do it if Batman is not really there....the world seems to sort itself out for him...</p>
<p>in a weird way...joker respects balance and the ability of society to self correct itself...no matter how tragic the events leading upto it might be - true Christianity, Karma - all good religious stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>the choice is with the bearer - ppl decide - not influenced -psy-oped into doing "good"</li>
</ul>
<p>batman .... for him...it is a hunt of sorts.... a problem, a disease which lies with society itself....incurable...unsolvable? </p>
<p>subtle hints...thomas wayne was a doctor...by profession.</p>
<p>batman always has a catwomen or something to remind him "pappa - ghar aa jaana" ;)</p>
<p>there is way more to Alan moore...
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gif from the killing joke : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke</p>
<p>It is like a modern Gita in a graphic novel....more gruesome...much misleading...seemingly to sort out people - on what they want to see....</p>
<p>Doubling down on delusions, as i do :</p>
<p>Alan moore is a genius, as well as the most sarcastic writer ever...</p>
<p>if you really understand Batman Vs Joker....</p>
<p>Joker might come out to be the hero - the one who has no choice....</p>
<p>Batman always did - still has</p>
<p>Isnt he the richest/most influential/well respected</p>
<p>in white knight fashion - he can choose to legalize or control anything - law, influence or money - all at his disposal - the 3 forms of matrix..</p>
<p>..yet he puts on a cape to rescue....with whole of capitalism at its disposal</p>
<p>he is as self destructive ....even more so as the joker.....</p>
<p>Thats Alan Moore slapping us in the face....all dark knight aficionados ....</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
