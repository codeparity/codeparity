                <p>Hack-ability of consumer electronics - the "techie" stuff</p>
<p>No matter how "open source" you go - the final frontier has always been the "invisible os" or the processor which you dont and cant control</p>
<p>In laptops/computers - it is the bios</p>
<p>In Phones - it is the baseband - the chip which ideally should be just doing the rf-digital-analog modem thing</p>
<p>But it does way, way more</p>
<p>the basic services - sms etc - will always have flaws - the "rf payload" is decoded, executed at these "invisible processors" running a closed source os</p>
<p>There are some partially known ways to interact - some of them are documented, most of them are not. One of the known ways to "hack a baseband" is to know the layers -</p>
<p>qmi </p>
<p>ril</p>
<p>baseband</p>
<p>uknown or reverse engineer-able. </p>
<p>Get a cert, hack a room would only get you this far - it is capitalism using your "hacks" to hack you  - a new brick - a new kind of huuumaaan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>glue-ing batteries to phones - apart from making them "thin" to hold, they also seem to ensure "uninterrupted" power to this baseband /os thingy...</p>
<p>firmware updates and alll...delta... ppl dont patch, vendors have delays or incentives to roll out "updates"...</p>
<p>no matter how "techie" one may go - this is a loop... a pattern which keeps the most basic thing out of focus</p>
<p>who made these devices ugly and so indiscriminate? are these really "smart" ppl??</p>

<p>I am sure they are good source of protein/nutrients etc</p>
<p>Bugs lie at the bottom of food chain. they serve a purpose to renew organic matter</p>
<p>It would also mean that they act as reservoir of toxins in circulation - heavy metals, microplastics etc</p>
<p>Science - in a world where Fungi/Mushrooms can grow where there is no sunlight</p>
<p>It seems about control, rather than "sustenance"</p>
<p>Leaders are never wrong though. I am confused since last vax (brain fog??)</p>

<p>It is not really hidden, just clocked beyond "carbon" and "feeling guilty of causing climate change"</p>
