                <p>Happy new year - 2024!!</p>
<p>Goals, resolutions and more 'time'  üòÄ </p>
<p>Last year, i wrote a whole big article about 'things', some predictions which came true and rest may be unfolding this year.</p>
<p>We made our bets, now the new game begins.</p>
<p>For paw and Codeparity, last year was amazing - we thrashed out ideas in ways which did not seem possible - thanks to the gPoodles and their gAntics for examples - many of them üòÇ </p>
<p>However, page 3 ppl decry on such 'hacks'...they dont like when 'likes' are not real, I would let them deal with that with gCelebrations....</p>
<p>I am about work and 2024 would be 'execution'.</p>
<p>Though, i would be doing engineering stuff, its effects are going to reverberate in some american town - </p>
<p>aww....2024 seems yum </p>
<p>this year would be nothing like we ever witnessed </p>
<p>In larger context, these are patterns, called witch "trials" in abdul/afred era ü§£ </p>
<p>all the best anons!! üòò </p>

<p>gave it up to follow alfred path...the alfred path which seems to make a bully = leader</p>
<p>it is not that black and white...experience teaches u that...</p>
<p>having the 'right' relative reasons makes intent++, no resistance in body/mind -&gt; hence intents</p>
<p>dexter to 50+ baldies is not something to 'like'...</p>
<p>the insight is really in mindset of a bully - how few seconds or words of assumed inflated ego perceived 'disrespect'....multiply and double up like an addicted gambler algo....</p>
<p>i know me - used that 'knowledge' to tame the experienced gBullies - now maybe xooglers,  many in making.</p>
<p>all avoidable, if bullies really knew - now it is indelible, unforgettable, unrepeatable - their peak is now their worst memory </p>

                <p>I am not "throwing 90s grads" term out of any "feelings", it is quite logical</p>
<p>graduated in 90s</p>
<p>=&gt; 20++ years of experiance</p>
<p>-leaders = highest order alfreds - telco, internet, apps - many 1s with 0s $$ and followers</p>
<p>-top management, middle management - all form habitus of 'cutting edge' tech, college, politics and even the pool of 'leadership'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>had access to tech : comp education was available to all of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>had 1st hand access to 0s and 1s - knowledge and opportunity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they knew, but were/are too comfortable to 'use' that knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>algos - all very visible in social strata - yet no 'guru' would identify them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mugging algos - just like brit masters intended to 'implement'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not learning algos - just like masters intended to 'imply'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fails on dharma</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fails on definition of progress - any dictionary</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so whats left??</p>
<p>just 'need of gratitude' and page 3 level bakwaas </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>some sweat shop inventor of inforsys - has been, telling next gens() to continue to majdoori/labor : it is the way of soros funded sensei.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some sorry yet, culturally potite gyaan - which no wannabe alfred should question - culture, respect and ll</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; we dint do anything 'worthwhile', yet we are the 'daddies'</p>
<p>no baldies</p>
<p>the sun, the earth </p>
<ul>
<li>they make everything possible, we just really 'channel' it to our 'ways'</li>
</ul>
<p>no gratitude</p>
<p>no respect</p>
<p>no disrespect</p>
<p>yet a balance of 'execution', a format is necessary - 2024.</p>
<p>masters are doing it anyways - no alfred knows when poodles are abandoned, he just thinks it wont be he/she/it/her/whatever.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i call sitting on desk as modern slavery/majdoori - forgetting the use of limbs - senses and their ability to diff psy ops - medical, work - $$, fame etc....</p>
<p>so really if your $$ may even rise, but would it be $++ with age++ as mental/medical-- and % of alfreds++?</p>
<p>yet i am the delusional 1..</p>
<p>$$ really establishes 'truth' etc++ - so thats the next 'game'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am all about real life examples, so taking a g_baldie_1 : check his progression, college, habitus, employment, title, words - every matrix dimension -</p>
<p>now consider his fate : denying 0s</p>
<p>we call it a 'rage quit' </p>
<p>what makes it memorable is, ironically the 'rockstar age' itself üòÇ </p>
<p>poignant leader : the limit</p>
<p>the words : limit</p>
<p>ability/googleyness : limit</p>
<p>age/experience : hacked till infinity</p>
<p>even Guide/Rajesh Khanna path is blocked - damm this global internet üòò </p>
<p>cant do a pathaan - k.k.k....kiran needs some muskle and movement</p>
<p>kya khoya?</p>
<p>Kya paaya?</p>
<p>all g_baldies[] really..</p>
<p>charan sparsha!!</p>

<p>music recommendation to baldies - now, now++ etc...</p>
<p>it is the emotion - the feeling - the stack[now], and ensuring now++ is aligned withing intent vectors of 0s/1s...</p>
