                <p>a 'black swan event'</p>
<p>she is not just talking economics - it is the trifecta of power - money, muscle and vision</p>
<p>lets ignore the grand 'intents' of g_baldies or baldies in general </p>
<p>// though its simple - money++, fame++ -&gt; laid_$++ = approval/success</p>
<p>the 'hack' in this alfred, compliance algo is simple - the exit condition - retirement or 'gyaan gurus' - the universal mentors</p>
<p>In reality,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there is no 'value' left, no ideas, just 'experience' of living a day over and over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>value in $$ : inflation, perception and assets - all relative to next alfred++</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>this is always a losing battle - based on larger pattern of 'recursion' - called habits/traits of an alfred </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the ultimate $$ psy hack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now i have more $$ than i can consume, what todo with $$++?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>investing is really the downfall for an alfred - money shows what ppl really are</p>
<p>-cars</p>
<p>-houses</p>
<p>-gadgets</p>
<p>-vacations/affairs</p>
<p>-cool stuff - material/emotional</p>
<p>how does this 'black swan' connect to 'blahBlah"?</p>
<p>"Intellectual impotence" - normalized, accepted and celebrated as part of 'success' - 90s 'pioneers' did 'invest' similarly.</p>
<p>'invest' - a grossly misunderstood yet manipulated term. Like everything, it is relative.</p>
<p>this 90s mass 'intelligence' has 'scaled'.</p>
<p>to me, a stray wolfie - it simply means karma </p>
<ul>
<li>of all 90s grads wagging their tails to western toilet paper - it made them feel 'clean'</li>

<p>imho, baldies, inc me  and their 'success/invaluable contribution' to whatever is not going to make much sense to next gens - tiktokies and instas - too cool to notice, too proud to admit - it is all there on 'youtube/ fav influencer' etc.</p>
<p>all part of "future"</p>
<p>.. who needs few out of rhyme/trends baldies who dont even know who pogan laul is - his cool drinks, unkle billy's rescue efforts, climate change, vax, need to darken the sun - elders are all part of it...they approve.</p>

                <p>the tai/chi ladder</p>
<p>prelude:</p>
<p>as you go baldie, like me in delusional midlifecrisis mode....</p>
<p>simple things in life tend to take a priority</p>
<p>sunday, good/bearable air - the sun god blessing like it always tries to...</p>
<p>so lets write some more imaginary delusional stuff which never happened</p>
<p>story:</p>
<p>i wasnt a baldie then</p>
<p>i just knew that i knew nothing - working in wessee - debugging hardware, oscilloscopes and all, without any help of internet - makes a good engineer out of you - a pure 1</p>
<p>Yet, the $$ salary was less, and my real mentor had to xfer for official reasons.</p>
<p>no learning, just few piddies trying to become 'leaders' after the real leader was gone.</p>
<p>So i went $$ - telco startup</p>
<p>I dint knew 'fine life' then...wessee is a very humble environment - your are humbled everyday with people who are good at what they do - coz mostly they 'want' to deliver - in best defense culture - overlooking few things, sidestepping most. - Rs 7 lunch and 2x v v creamy tea..</p>
<p>Telco Startup 1</p>
<p>work was good.</p>
<p>ppl were good</p>
<p>mentors were awesome </p>
<p>till  eno &lt; 100</p>
<p>then Tai Chai ladder was invented - the better way to 'live'</p>
<p>I dont know about health - none of them had any diameter_delta--</p>
<p>but then, its function was something else...</p>
<p>i was really tech++ then - ugly and all, only trying to make up for $$, 'status+=0' after loss of my father then.</p>
<p>Then, after a few years of really working - i realized what tai-chai was really was :</p>
<p>-an enlightenment quest</p>
<p>-buddhas qualify for it</p>
<p>-skip work, or choose work or make time - to become a leader</p>
<p>and few did - they dint deliver any projects or anything...the did try though...</p>
<p>wimax - was a sure shot bet</p>
<p>android - we were the 'pioneers'</p>
<p>apps - coolest telco apps ever made..</p>
<p>it was existing amongst the gods.</p>
<p>Learn tai-chai anons </p>
<ul>
<li>see the 'perception', the cheap gyaan sold off as 'management knowledge' - the alfreds of society - rich ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>I dint learn tai- chai, i think Dhalsim doesnt represent now, it represented an Indian being judged for not being an alfred</p>
<p>Now- how does it matter ??</p>
<p>delusions cant manifest sucess - i am delusional - someone wrote it in an official communication - so cant deny it...</p>
<p>as always - u see what u want to see.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>here - i ported roms, to new boards, version++, sometimes drivers - simple ones...</p>
<p>made a framework sold off multiple times - a mentor claimed to have 'invented' it, and I merely helped him</p>
<p>...a mentor sold out for corner office, a childs tantrum, and then doubling up on the seniority++ by acting like 5 footiya nickeodean version of godfather</p>
<p>i took pity - really.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are some 'baldies' who know that they know better....just a Q - really do u?</p>
<p>are u relevant?</p>
<p>did u really deliver as 'leader'?</p>
<p>did u pass on the 'torch'?</p>
<p>did u obey they shishya/chela realtionship - called mentorship by alfreds.</p>
<p>The bigger takeaway for me - i chose skill, un-apologetically and i did pay $$ for it - a 0, a very 'small 1' - my 0 was v v less than </p>
<p>telco closed its windows - the royal salute to all 'mentors' was given - verbally, or in silence - too big to take on....too much time...cant really tell the cows to stop mooing...</p>
<p>i respect cows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i did hold some sacred 'millionaire sureshot $$ stock' - too bad it seemed not worth the 'esop rs$$ ~ 5k then"</p>
<p>a choice - made knowing what i knew - knowing the actors and the real glass ceiling - of gods of telco!!</p>
<p>hats off </p>
<ul>
<li>the hq had real leaders - best run of my life - california - the best ppl.</li>

                <p>Ego and "Pre-Empteening" Baldie attacks. - Defense &amp;&amp; Offense</p>
<p>What i am story-telling here - is a v v 'nice' abstraction of the 'niceness' of baldies.</p>
<p>g_baldies[] were/are not the first baldies to cross my path, steal ip/ideas, eating salary etc...</p>
<p>One of the most deceptive desi lizard is literally named after Street Fighter baddie - Bison</p>
<p>In real life - S Bison....</p>
<p>the 'entrepreneur' 'visionary' - who literally destroyed and continue to mislead all newbie telecom engineers - with perception - for decades now.</p>
<p>The reason i am using this perceived 'low blow' tactic - of online de-masking is for something which i perceive greater good - next gen should do better than this nobody, nevebeen, glorified broker.</p>
<p>Oh - he is going to get real sued for real code stealing - it was just me prioritizing human targets to hack - in a very delhi-joker way.</p>
<p>In Codeparity - we call it 'debug' - knowing the 'problem'</p>
<p>The reason, which elevated this nobody, neverbeen, hasbeen, wannabe 5 foot of glory - hakla english, nepotistic traits - to my focus is simple - karma is due.</p>
<p>so bisen - i r next, dont do the baldie trick of 'age forgivenes' - a hindu would have retired or apologized or just do 'chully bhar paani....'</p>
<p>The larger reason - concept of forgiveness - what it really means, and how society - erswhile nobody baldies - denying retirement for blue_pills++, hot_hr++, car++ while(){ cout&lt;&lt;"Oh economy is bad";} </p>
<p>scales - balance with % - we "digital telesoftware engineers" - one of the best bunch of hungry engineers - all brokered by few 'baldies, telecom geniuses' - to the real slavery we were sold off to a lala of great repute - including PF - left lalu behind.</p>
<p>M bison is taller, doesnt have napoleon complex - he is a villain, but a good one.</p>

<p>i dont want to glorify the 'genius' of g_class of 'intellect' and 'title' achievers more...this is 1 thing i need to remove from my stack...so this is the end of g_baldie_1 and associated clique - it is more than 'symbolic' - karma and all...</p>
<p>it would be hindsight soon, and exercising the luxury of hindsight...</p>
<p>old ppl have a moral and biological responsibility to define 'progress'</p>
<ul>
<li>ban it under ageism or whatever : merit or $ capitalism simply has no room for 'emotions' in a 'cos' wave of $ capitalism</li>
</ul>
<p>yearly reports, results, projections - all 'flows' when $$ is easy</p>
<p>nepotism got them there, so winds blow in laid down path - the already traveled 1 - laid down by an alfred</p>
<p>the "strategy" as a general CS engineer</p>
<p>find the common 'class' - the intersections which make non merit base ppl 'click'</p>
<p>here - age, habitus, mediocrity based origins - self build and persisted cockroach jar</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>music, taste, intellect - bhojpuri needs - masked by western pop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in 'intent' and in 'actions'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>huddles and all - all cheap pvt whatsap etc</p>
<p>the common 'classes' - the constraints of 'perception' of G - the limits</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the limits of these 'wannabe= new Googlers()'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the real 'ability/googleyness'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>there are hacks/limits to each 1 of these 'classes'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>hacks in each of them classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alfred is already hacked - by lifestyle - $$ - need/want : he knows no diff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'time' : thats 1s life </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>V v hackable.</p>
<p>my skill / alfred job : Computere Science engg -&gt; sr. engg -&gt; principal engg -&gt; lead -&gt; head -&gt; enterpreneur -&gt; cto -&gt; googler6 -&gt; </p>
<p>now this-&gt;.</p>
<p>A society doesnt allow for this.</p>
<p>society = religion + $ capitalism</p>
<p>all this - just my verification of my 'paw' - 1st instance of 'CodeParity'</p>
<p>an idea 'explored, evaluated, validated -&gt; documented'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a reverse engineered 'religion' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all coz some wannabe, nevenver bee...rant++</p>
</li>
</ul>
