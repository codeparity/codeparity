<p>humans</p>
<p>audio/video/.. -&gt; values/bias -&gt; action</p>
<p>Is it really that simple for us?</p>
<p>apparently no.</p>
<p>choice - sometimes cannot be processed - specially if the mind is not "trained" for that situation.</p>
<p>"Education/Learning" can be a Psy/Op if it is being followed without 'reason'</p>
<p>Religion - an example of the most prevalent psy/op - a set of steps, practices - which seem to 'benefit' the prayer </p>
<p>without reason</p>
<p>without explanation</p>
<p>just</p>
<p>decisions - unknown ones - are made by 'something' which science cannot define.</p>
<p>consciousness - seems to be the 'abstract' word assigned to it.</p>
<p>Without 'consciousness', can any artificial program be called life? </p>
<p>the bigger question - who makes that 'choice' when it was made the 1st time?</p>
<p>Impulse?</p>
<p>Dna?</p>
<p>Ancestors?</p>
<p>Religious God?</p>
<p>All religious Gods?</p>

<p>our lives ... can be visualized as 'choices' made at a particular time.</p>
<p>if done as time series, the 'tree' of decisions in different directions may become big, messy - 1's choices manifested as matters, people, issues and 'needs/wants'</p>

<p>choice.</p>
<p>most of the time ppl want both....</p>
<p>mountain in their own ego...</p>
<p>when u dont know which direction/purpose to take - the vector is going to end up no where - just a spiral of addiction and a hole of shape, instead of 'mountain'</p>

<p>trees grow on mountains.</p>
<p>mountains - are built by blackrocks. they have names like boogle, mecrohard etc.</p>

                <p>Debugging the "wants" of a 0:</p>
<p>Lets be v v simple - masters/alfreds did a good job in making symbols of use</p>
<p>0 1 - binary</p>
<p>If AI run on binary hardware can mimic and outsmart human intellect in any way, then the basic constructs themselves build the complex pattern we call humanity - we, us - pronouns and all</p>
<p>Lets just assign a basic abstraction - of genders to these symbols</p>
<p>0- feminine - the cosmic egg, the one which has all the possibility and creativity</p>
<p>1- masculine - the will/the effort which realizes that creativity</p>
<p>both are as useless or as important as each other.</p>
<p>but human life is not as simple 😀 </p>
<p>real time passes through it - not computer clocks (which have limits - matrix hack)</p>
<p>hence, my logical assertion of labels of any gender - opposition to it.</p>
<p>simple question - can i 'buy' something without 'trying' it?</p>
<p>rent vs buy</p>
<p>a binding, a private assertion being exploited by the hamster wheel of $ capitalism - the prophets, the influencers, the critics and the sheep </p>
<ul>
<li>all exhibiting the very real life pattern of sine/cos wave....</li>
</ul>
<p>though - the only unnatural law in all this is the unsaid one </p>
<ul>
<li>$ and its creators 'control' and manipulate this progressive flow - to keep it in a loop - </li>
</ul>
<p>0 hacked to become  ∞ for a few "pure" - who cant even face sunlight 😘 </p>

<p>Brit masters created "infinity"... 'pure' intellect</p>
<p>0+0 = ∞, one 90 degree turn,</p>
<p>basically a $ + $ = ∞</p>
<p>the inbred iq only allows so much 'original genius'</p>
<p>0 and ∞ are in some sense - the same thing...the pattern which 'masters' dont seem to 'understand'</p>
<p>∞ means explosion/implosion</p>
<p>0 means what comes after that...</p>
<p>see - their intellect aint that great either. 😀 </p>

<p>it gets more apparent when you see ∞ in practicality - in tech...</p>
<p>i had to google this inverted, copulating snakes ∞ symbol  ...</p>
<p>it has no 'practical' use</p>
<p>just an 'imaginary' concept - which 70 iq ppl claim to 'understand'</p>

                <p>Finding 0s</p>
<p>it is the real work.</p>
<p>it calms your body down, your brain, your emotions</p>
<p>addictions become a function of trauma, or things 1 really wants.</p>
<p>Painful - yes.</p>
<p>Does it ever ends - 🙂 </p>
<p>No, the perspective of 0 carries over</p>
<p>eg, </p>
<p>imagine yourselves as a very small person - just moving away from city of towers, skyscrapers etc</p>
<p>moving out - cutting yourself out - a zero, helps you identify those towers</p>
<p>you may not see all, but you will see what you are interested in.</p>
<p>Constraints, needs - they really show them when you are at 0.</p>
<p>You will be someone's need.</p>
<p>not want.</p>
<p>and you would have wants - they will become clear.</p>
<p>When you know your 0 - the material freedom - financial freedom - seems quite easy to compute.</p>
<p>see - not all doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Then you come out and do yapping. </p>
