<p>Stadia/Gaming - Alfred Pichai's "booger" of 5G gaming dint stick </p>
<p>Real nerds are ppl who fake passions...</p>
<p>Gaming - Anyone who ever really went beyond "offline" or even had courage to walk into "arcades", would know how R/T, reliability is the key parameter.</p>
<p>But here we have a nerd who thought </p>
<p>"Cloud + Gaming" = winner üòé </p>
<p>The casteist/regional/mummy pappa recommended "colleagues" rejoiced - YAY üòç </p>
<p>Booger can do no wrong - unsaid mass consensus.</p>
<p>So we "had" Stadia 2019 - build for future ( shud be now )</p>
<p>It can only get better - they said!</p>
<p>Oh it did - they threw money, bought influencers</p>
<p>The booger still dint stick</p>
<p>4 years of money pump</p>
<p>Including the golden "corona" time</p>
<p>The average reaction time to visual stimulus is around 250 milliseconds</p>
<p>dns 3 ms</p>
<p>tcp ~20 ms</p>
<p>data bw ~ 20 mbps kinds - hevc and all</p>
<p>latency, jitter - real world "things"</p>
<p>considering - they are all "envisioned" to use 5G....higher freq bands - low penetration, specially in denser areas - where cityfolk - a typical gamer lives</p>
<p>No technikal googley this - alfred pichai really aimed for a "moonshot" - a 10x thing</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The "stadia" controller itself - is a wireless thing...</p>
<p>the public bandwidth...is really not a space to conduct realtime business...</p>
<p>they invented whole standards for real timeness - mil -1553 etc...just to eliminate frame retransmissions</p>
<p>muggers...they expose themselves....getting those 99% would mean u had no social life - arcade or gaming was viewed more like "casino for kids" or "bad kids hang out there" or "jua/gambling"</p>
<p>v safe assumption that the kind which designed "stadia" never really gamed - just a nerd who "imagined" a "PD" - the nepotistic environment - just go üëç on the most successful alfred of India.</p>
<p>-a fan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>layers - tcp retransmissions bring uncertainty for the gamer</p>
<p>Frame redraws - on top of a game's own online mechanism coping algos - delay, loss, wifi - local connectivity adaptations...</p>
<p>this was just an amazing thought process...worked out wonders</p>
<p>A fan of work of pichai!</p>

<p>Gaming - is really the future in many wef sense, as well as in common sense.</p>
<p>It is an opportunity...would unfold later. now making "mooonnneeyyy"</p>

<p>One of the "disrespectful" or mini dharma lessons are learnt in arcade/streets in my days:</p>
<p>In arcade - the age/size dint matter - it was the joystick and buttons which anyone can press - or get skilled at</p>
<p>As the kid who found this fascinating -  a whiz kid at video games ..but consequences were real, in streets...baldies..and their egoes...</p>
<p>It dint matter then - kinda became local legend in local arcade circles.</p>
<p>The lessons remained - some ppl live that life - Daigo, Tokido, Momochi and they excel - inspire</p>
<p>We - the Indian stray kind - go to code for Brit masters....</p>
<p>Times - they  sure change.</p>

<p>My only problem with Big Tech employees is purely logical.</p>
<p>They are supposed to be "smart", but most of them dint saw this coming, and most importantly - are not "googley" enough to deal with it.</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dfzBcVi3</p>
<p>Nepotism - the leadership, has very real consequences - we are just witnessing people who are suffering due to it. </p>
<p>The real "bharatRatnas" - they know, they plan.</p>
<p>X - they are all going down - the smartest ppl on planet.</p>
<p>this was way way evident - 2 years back - to even a "backbencher", "NI", stray like me.</p>
<p>Karma : the true "interest / %" comes due. Money is just an approximation of "value"</p>

<p>/*</p>
<p>blahBlah = a former booger employee, brandished - 'non-performer' aka "not as good"/ "Needs Improvement" etc</p>
<p>blahBlah, being very 'improving' - self beating kinds...took it seriously</p>
<p>worked through the self bias, dark night of soul blah and all</p>
<p>it worked.</p>
<p>so blahBlah went to work - logic and execution</p>
<p>this was 2 years back</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>blahBlah was a bully too - in another life, before "duties" took over</p>
<ul>
<li>wolf...of kinds...</li>
</ul>
<p>*/</p>
<p>Now Blah Blah does "Blah Blah" - only pointing out "inconsistencies" in the way of "masters"</p>
<p>well - the master kind of took "an initiative" to brandish blahBlah as "non complaint sheep"</p>
<p>They were right, just that blahBlah wasnt sheep to begin with.</p>
<p>Time - the only thing which eluded blahBlah, due to the circus of "genius ppl" who were "duties" at that time, place.</p>
<p>Time is a wonderful thing. </p>
<p>The very thing which defines "life".</p>
<p>Yet, every pup born or unborn - has his "time" precalculated for him - education, competition - jobs, spouse, cars, sheep++</p>
<p>Time allows you to discern, take a step back .... just to get a perspective of why blahBlah started playing this "circus" without even knowing it....</p>
<p>Science - seems stalled since WW2</p>
<p>Computers - should have "accelerated" innovation</p>
<p>Genome decode - should have atleast cured "headaches" or pimples</p>
<ul>
<li>it just doesnt make sense - inventing ai to replace "us", when "us" is no where near perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>all that blahBlah, is just snake talk...</p>
<p>we talk about baldie vengence... it is real.</p>
<p>so baldie hcI 0rackle fame never understood "brand"</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it tells a lot about ppl - being "indian" is a brand too - do they use it, or give it back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a 70 iq genius baldie, way past his expiry date - due to his attitude, is bound to overestimate his "genius" - no sense of "value", just money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so he assimiliated his hcI bretren - to echo the version of "genius" they ran</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it becomes "truth or GValues"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gThanks amongst this new "bretren" of genius -defines a new culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is barking at cows at his point - the older ones mooed -while hyenas took over - there was no hope.</p>
<p>the surrender of values.</p>
<p>a lot of words were said.</p>
<p>One kind of triggered blahBlah - 'aukat'</p>
<p>It is a very crude way of asking someone of his "worth".</p>
<p>No matter how much blahBlah hated it, this word has hounded him forever - since long.</p>
<p>There was the real enemy.</p>
<p>Now cut to 2023, the high of baldies is over.</p>
<p>The "brand" pimping done by the erstwhile respectable baldies is being "unpeeled" at various layers - something genius level nepotistic iq baldies never realized</p>
<p>What to do?? Spanking is coming from the alfred above??</p>
<p>Hire a third party.</p>
<p>Find the "hacks" in blahBlah - welcome to try.</p>
<p>Just a 'namaste' to "brand management"</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the joker.</li>

                <p>Constructing X of my own</p>
<p>X </p>
<p>2 lines intersecting at an angle</p>
<p>In capitalism/engineering - it is 2 entities </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one which is at peak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one which is at 0 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>0 is unknown - exists on paper, but not in a capitalistic world</p>
<p>G is at peak - it wont get any better ( informed rats are already fleeing)</p>
<p>0 is not even known.</p>
<p>I dint like money</p>
<p>for me, it seems to bring out worst in them.</p>
<p>Something which is "good" for someone, but "bad" for everyone.</p>
<p>No, no amount of "checks" to "developing" countries will undo the plastic crap you ppl end up manufacturing.</p>
<p>eg "googlers" - the fart smelling group on "Big Tech"</p>
<p>that smart - that they invented have free energy?</p>
<p>Free Internet?</p>
<p>Free Food?</p>
<p>Oh, they can do all thatt - but they are slaves who have to fondle the shriveled nuts of shwab, soros, wef, bis or whatever psy/op "intellectually superior" huddle some people have created for themselves.</p>
<p>No leaders.</p>
<p>No gods.</p>
<p>No alfreds.</p>
<p>Big words - you bet.</p>
<p>4 years?</p>
<p>maybe less?</p>
<p>maybe delusional?</p>
<p>I have been all my life - baldies kept telling me that.</p>
<p>i cant spot any baldies now - they dont like me.</p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>Everything starts with a "paw"!</p>
<p>I finally found a way to unload the "psy op intellectual crap" that explains the so called "matrix"</p>
<p>will "time" it with v v "hacky" but logical and explainable values - layers</p>
<p>till then....i told u what u need to know.</p>
<p>Apologies if blah blah bothered you </p>
<p>Now, i create üôÇ  </p>

<p>One of the patterns of $/snake ppl - they have skills to "adjust" pivot on fly, with awesome reflexes - snake dont walk</p>
<p>I dont walk straight either...dont have to - joker here.</p>
