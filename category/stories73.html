<p>yeah - maybe u will </p>
<p>either you skill up so no "genius" can defy logic or manners</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>you find a professional sugar daddy in one of these companies</p>
<p>there is no other way - best real advise u would never find anywhere</p>

<p>Purpose thing is real....else i would be wagging my stray tail to boomer baldies and their HCL/Oraclite hall of fame of wisdom...</p>
<p>and the "leaders" of the world would be liking "vax, esg, dei" and your/my kid...would already be theirs - in mental and maybe in physical sense - true Orwellian fantasy realized in CA by fentynl and these "geniuses" who are insecure to burn 18 hours in office - to scheme and plot their "empires"</p>
<p>....the kids would rather like a dad/mom with a big house/car..</p>
<p>yours might - my wont. </p>
<p>no one is genius enough to say this - i will.</p>
<p>btw - the level of question at booglie cloud : which port does a dns server run on??</p>

<p>"leaders", googlers and "role-models" - for weak willed, unskilled, greedy - future newbie alfreds.</p>
<p>The essential part of last 18 months was - i did not want to deal with these ppl </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>degrades my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fighting with pigs in mud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for money, fame - 2 of the most limiting things when u want to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a general assault on physical senses of sight, hearing and 'logic'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;lose time and energy - genius level tail wagging comps.</p>
<p>the "brand" is mud now. Google will be going downhill from now on - eu/brics ...u ll see.</p>
<p>I ll do my part - the mail has all the names, verbal lying recordings and a lot of "other stuff" </p>
<ul>
<li>so lets be done with "genius booglers" - light that fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not new - the out of warranty oldies and their ego massaging alfreds have crossed my path, only to find out the significance of "Tanwar" 🙂 </p>
<p>The game could have been over the day i resorted to lowest layers of existence - nihilism - i came from it. </p>
<p>Subtle things which you realize when u have outplayed it - the game is as good as the opponent - a defeat is a win if the opponent has skills which you admire - helps you imbibe them.</p>
<p>A game with fake leaders and their psychological/virtual/real offsprings has no win for me.</p>
<p>I took time to debug myself - last 20 years changed something in my psych, the silence which was there when i needed it, was not there.</p>
<p>I couldn't enjoy coding - my initial "feeling" when i chose CS as career.</p>
<p>The answer was much deeper and it took time.</p>
<p>Money perverted my motivations in ways that it was too subtle to debug.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to pinpoint the reason - the tools, the ide, the os, or the hardware or me.</p>
<p>It took some time, and now we are back. </p>
<p>Lets play our own game now, shall we?</p>
<p>A win has a proud feeling to it - it feels pure, earned, innovative in some sense.</p>
<p>Codeparity "Paw" - u ll hear about it....maybe in next 6 months.</p>
<p>Money - is a tricky force - it can switch sides in most weird ways.</p>
<p>Thanks and TC.</p>

<p>if i "knock one out of the park"....which i am known to do "now and then".... it solves for itself 😀 </p>
<p>Kind of doing an innovation++ here, a new product, with new "non woke" mannerisms, innovation in baldie teaching.....just too much...</p>
<p>becoming a side note in someone's "win" is really a good future...a joker would have liked a better origin story though....i liked being lazy way too much
