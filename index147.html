</li>
</ul>
<p>then...what is going behind it all the 'fear' is 1 basic fact - we depend on 'masters'</p>
<p>our yesses, likes are 'pre - installed' in knowledge, job trainings etc</p>
<p>baphomet and its existence seems real - day by day...</p>
<p>wonder if it is a real creature....godzilla, or "kotal kahn" types ...</p>

<p>if aliens are real - and that is 1 story/disclosure that would be really 'timed'  - it is the ultimate predator tactic...</p>

<p>The delhi i grew up had a weird culture - every sunday, every unkle would take out his car, scooter etc - to give it a weekly routine</p>
<p>it was socializing, maintenance, sunbathing, exchange of tools - knowledge </p>
<ul>
<li>everything logical - there was not internet then</li>
</ul>
<p>it created an ecosystem in itself - tools, knowledge, innovation was often done in these 'money minded' yet social indian bunch - the good of capitalism</p>
<p>same can be said about week day/end markets - they are not just bargain spree now - money and food affordability has been been organically maintained due to culture and practicality of it</p>
<p>all that blah - just to underline a basic perspective of luxury vs dependence</p>
<p>a neighborhood where no one knows how to jack a car when its really needed</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>a an aggregator app which provides few hours of operation, but gives a plastic shiny card?</p>

<p>One of the weird yet illogical things done in India - $ capitalism is to put 10/15 years on 'longevity' of their cars</p>
<p>who would maintain their vehicles - they have a depreciating $$ attached to it</p>
<p>it is "indian" done wrong - there should be no logical debate about this - govt using ppl and vehicles as cash cows - fines, maintenance, pollution certs yet - no logical sense of it all - other than ppl forced to 'disown' their cars - the paperwork in vintage and all  is all bakwaas when all is needed/wanted is pollution certs.</p>

<p>this just making "distributed systems" cities - which are organic - they existed before $$ went out of gold standard..</p>
