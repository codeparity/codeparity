<p>some context - good english speakers, malleable, non corrosive culture - perfect tax payers.</p>
<p>tech - seems natural for all "science" written in eng..</p>
<p>so phy, science etc - seemed to be 'achievement' - hence iits etx</p>
<p>$fuelled 'innovation' in India - what sells in west kinds..</p>
<p>flipfart, zemazon - etc  data, habits, patterns - likes, desires etc ...</p>
<p>mostly alfreds/abduls - with different 'personal time' dejjjires.</p>
<p>mtv world - then bollywood made "gems" of intellectual capabilities of pathans by pathans - all awesome</p>
<p>perfect complaint - yes mans - loyal poodles.</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>$ magic is fading away - but clawing at last straw</p>
<p>$ internet cant work on genuine money - it was the imaginary $ and dejjires of 'fine life - cannibals' and all - just wanting "diversity" in flavor - empire - control...</p>
<p>where is the "money"??</p>
<p>If Bharat becomes China of Food - good, non expensive 1.</p>
<p>Tech has limits of utility - when the motion and movement is still dependent on a coil and magnet - i dont really think there is much to fear - master are just being funny - angrez version of it ðŸ˜€ </p>

<p>masters need ppl to remain masters - so anything $ would never really become 0 </p>

<p>in my delusional mind...it is a x between 2 strains of entirely different kinds...so there would be no debate about "natural" origins now...</p>
<p>parity - master, alfreds, abduls, strays - would be maintained - no matter what the 'right' one is - the universe seems to be saying so since 2000 known years...but...everyone is right.. ðŸ˜€ </p>

<p>kind of repeated my own journey - went to $ doctors - workshop etc...only to see the 'official' apathy...</p>
<p>then it kind of became a 0 - even abduls saw it as a cow of cash.. ðŸ˜€ </p>

<p>I dont want to be one of those ppl who tell others to read their stuff or follow - but i also believe in choices - sometimes the purest things need most awkward origins - this was a thought - in progress.</p>
<p>whatever has been described, is painfully coming true - and i would have rather loved isolation and irrelevance than becoming ' a told u so guy'</p>
<p>read up, to prepare and anticipate - a stray did it, a 'leader' like u - would get it faster.</p>
