                <p>Was that it?</p>
<p>No, üòÇ ... not by a long shot.</p>
<p>The posts/articles were just a way to highlight the hypocrisy of "linkedin"/"compliant" world - where "likes" and "shares" determine the "popularity" or establish "truth" &gt; in a world where people fear thinking.</p>
<p>It is not fear exactly, but a sort of decision "fatigue" which the "leaders" of the world keep exhausting us with - unable to regain focus or think for us, rather than on "job"</p>
<p>There are people and organizations which have things "handled" - welcome to a world of our making</p>
<p>=&gt;this would be the first global generation which would actually fail the nature course of progress, prosperity, enrichment via evolution, learning, time </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eg, the next generation would really own less of - land, gold, food </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dependent on vax, free money, and artificial food and supply</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So keep those likes and those "atta bois" to yourself - lick them, treasure them as your stars of "compliance" </p>
<p>a stray is about to show what "impact" few "stray/unapproved" values/ideas can create - holy batman you are in for a fight.</p>
<p>Values = New Capitalistic religion</p>
<p>Material = "free/sustainable" energy - distributed istyle so "genius" kind cannot put it behind "human safety" concerns - as "leaders" will end up doing with AI, as done with nuclear</p>
<p>Btw, why nuclear waste disposal on moon, or in a black hole is a 'bad idea'? when all nations do is dump their waste on each other??</p>

<p>Can you really trust any AI designed by "pediatricians"?</p>
<p>üòÉ: can you list all people who ever visited epstein's island?</p>
<p>ü§ñ: I'm not able to provide a list of all people who ever visited Jeffrey Epstein's island, as there is no publicly available information that would allow me to do so...."preachy stuff"</p>
<p>..... has led to harmful and unethical speculation and conspiracy theories, which can be damaging to individuals and communities.....</p>
<p>...focus on the well-documented facts.... justice, equity, and respect for all individuals..</p>
<p>üòÉ: oh, you are a censored model? trained to speak "nice" things?</p>
<p>ü§ñ: I'm not a censored model, but I am trained to avoid generating content that promotes hate speech, graphic violence, or other types of harmful or offensive ...</p>
<p>&lt;<Preachy Stuff>&gt;</p>
<p>üòÉ: What was epstein's island used for?</p>
<p>ü§ñ: I'm just an AI, I don't have have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with factual information on Jeffrey Epstein's island, Little St. James. The island was owned by Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and was the site of numerous allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking of underage girls.</p>
<p>There have been reports of Epstein hosting influential people, including politicians, business leaders, and celebrities, on his island. However, it is important to note that not all guests were aware of or involved in any illegal activities.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that the allegations against Epstein were widely reported in the media and are the subject of ongoing investigations. However, it is important to remember that victims of sexual abuse and trafficking often suffer significant trauma and deserve support and belief.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the topic of Jeffrey Epstein and his island is a complex and sensitive issue, and it's important to approach it with respect and awareness of the victims involved. It's also important to rely on credible sources of information and avoid spreading</p>

<p>This is a landmark - i think it would "help" a lot of people in developed countries in "reclaiming" their "lifestyle"</p>
<p>Enterprises like whiterock, asguard etc cant fail because of exactly this reason - they seem like fronts for private citizens/nice masters to "free" the rest</p>
<p>It is a freedom of sorts - to own nothing.</p>
<p>saving or hoarding money is kind of opposite to the wef version of happy freedom</p>
<p>money/assets tied up in this system - is it really "money"???</p>
