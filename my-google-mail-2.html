                <p><strong>This is the second of the mails which i sent to the whole India&nbsp;team.</strong></p>
<p>The gang of <em>hasbeens</em> got visibly enraged after mail 1. A decent last working date was too much to ask for, warnings and notices followed. It did not&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>Jan 10, 2022, 1:00 <span class="caps">PM</span></p>
<p>Dear&nbsp;All,</p>
<p>I just submitted my resignation. I don&#8217;t care if they compensate, or fine me. I am gone from today.
Apologies to my colleagues, I waited to make sure I passed the baton to the right set of people, I think you will do well. I am walking out thinking that I have not let you down as a colleague or as a person or what is expected out of a commodity <span class="caps">NI</span>(<em>Needs Improvement</em>) rated&nbsp;L6.</p>
<p>I hope that you would find courage to speak when leadership is just playing musical chairs within themselves, while the people who actually do the work wait for a year to get migrated or find better options outside. This is harmful to Gargle, and the country as a whole. This &#8220;rebellion&#8221; is my expression of solving for a bigger cause than myself - Parity should be restored after this, and you need to leverage this chance to restore culture, logic in this team. I am making sure that this cannot be curbed at a regional level.
Do trust <em>internalUselessLink1</em> - you may end up succeeding like me and believe me - the biggest challenge for me was accepting the reality of it, keeping my sanity at work and personal life. My former buddy knows all about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I will speak from a position of strength when you next hear from me. I have better things to do, dealing with goinmul coterie is there, but like at priority 5. It&#8217;s Gargle&#8217;s fault, not mine to&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p>Keep in touch - linkedin, whatsapp etc are good. TeamBlind.com is&nbsp;excellent.</p>
<p>To my Managers(s) and <em>uselessops</em> team:
I want to acknowledge my failure to adhere to <span class="caps">PIP</span> since I was rated <span class="caps">NI</span> in October&nbsp;2021.</p>
<p>The last day is 26 April 2022, the same day my second tranche of <span class="caps">GSU</span>&#8217;s mature. I hope to have no further negotiations or communication on&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>In spirit of accountability, few developments-
<em>Bill</em> for <em>CustomerAyurvedaMajor2</em> <em>Opportunity1</em> has been raised - 100% confident that you will win this.
<em>CustomerDifficult1</em> is executing an <span class="caps">IIOT</span> opportunity with us, this needs holdhanding as its a pure <span class="caps">IIOT</span> win with an incumbent partner.
<em>PartnerGood1</em> is all slated to sign up as exclusive or optimal partner for Gargle Cloud&#8217; <span class="caps">IIOT</span> practice - across the whole subcontinent. I was able to convince them to model their solution on Gargle Cloud&#8217;s <span class="caps">IIOT</span> reference architecture - did this in 2 hours - 2/3 meetings. (<em>PartnerGood1</em>  team is a good, considering the low <span class="caps">POC</span> cost and their hunger to succeed.)
&#64;my <span class="caps">NI</span> rating manager and leadership in general - I just gave you the biggest callout of your life. My advise&nbsp;:</p>
<p>Respect <em>InternalSurvey</em> results.
Do what you are hired to do - geo strat based deal making should be the best lever.
If people are leaving&#8230;..linkedin leadership shares - you need to&nbsp;act.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all there in the motto - Dinosaurs&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Thanks for the ride and fuelling me with enough contempt to fire for next few years, thought I was burnt&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Ashish</p>
<p>Ps:
To the people who still like me - I am starting a new venture, will keep you posted via linkedin/codeparity.com(its on Gargle Workspace), or just reach out. I am on a quest to define IndianNess - We were and are quite capable of being sustainable. I have it planned like a suspense novel - It would be worth it - some shawshank stuff coming up - all from an underdog who came from nowhere and is absolutely expected to get burned (0% employment probability after&nbsp;this)</p>
<p>Dear manager(s) - This is what i told you about - &#8220;Joker&#8221; mode : a guy who has a bad day and turns the values of an institution against it, I hope you get it&#8230;.and yes i have thought through - I &#8220;know&#8221;&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Personal message to the leader who likes &#8220;imagine dragons&#8221; and &#8220;pink floyd&#8221; - poetic justice coming right up? &#8230;. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_JF8oSxXtM">Motorhead&nbsp;Fan</a></p>
<p>On Googleness - This is the last bit of my duty to Gargle - I will not sue you - someone else may, gears are turning, and it would be beautiful - the hundreds of hours i wasted in explaining and justifying myself - it is going to multiply on you. Time/efficiency is the real currency, not $$$ or account&nbsp;plans.</p>
