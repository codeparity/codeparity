                <p><strong>This is the second and final mail which i sent to the whole India team.</strong></p>
<p>The gang of <em>hasbeens</em> got visibly enraged after mail 1. A decent last working date was too much to ask for, warnings and notices followed. It did not matter. This one is nicer though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jan 10, 2022, 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I just submitted my resignation. I don't care if they compensate, or fine me. I am gone from today.
Apologies to my colleagues, I waited to make sure I passed the baton to the right set of people, I think you will do well. I am walking out thinking that I have not let you down as a colleague or as a person or what is expected out of a commodity NI(<em>Needs Improvement</em>) rated L6.</p>
<p>I hope that you would find courage to speak when leadership is just playing musical chairs within themselves, while the people who actually do the work wait for a year to get migrated or find better options outside. This is harmful to Gargle, and the country as a whole. This &quot;rebellion&quot; is my expression of solving for a bigger cause than myself - Parity should be restored after this, and you need to leverage this chance to restore culture, logic in this team. I am making sure that this cannot be curbed at a regional level.</p>
<p>Do trust <em>internalUselessLink1</em> - you may end up succeeding like me and believe me - the biggest challenge for me was accepting the reality of it, keeping my sanity at work and personal life. My former buddy knows all about it.</p>
<p>I will speak from a position of strength when you next hear from me. I have better things to do, dealing with goinmul coterie is there, but like at priority 5. It's Gargle's fault, not mine to correct.</p>
<p>Keep in touch - linkedin, whatsapp etc are good. TeamBlind.com is excellent.</p>
<p>To my Managers(s) and <em>uselessops</em> team:
I want to acknowledge my failure to adhere to PIP since I was rated NI in October 2021.</p>
<p>The last day is 26 April 2022, the same day my second tranche of GSU's mature. I hope to have no further negotiations or communication on this.</p>
<p>In spirit of accountability, few developments-</p>
<p><em>Bill</em> for <em>CustomerAyurvedaMajor2</em> <em>Opportunity1</em> has been raised - 100% confident that you will win this.</p>
<p><em>CustomerDifficult1</em> is executing an IIOT opportunity with us, this needs holdhanding as its a pure IIOT win with an incumbent partner.</p>
<p><em>PartnerGood1</em> is all slated to sign up as exclusive or optimal partner for Gargle Cloud' IIOT practice - across the whole subcontinent. I was able to convince them to model their solution on Gargle Cloud's IIOT reference architecture - did this in 2 hours - 2/3 meetings. (<em>PartnerGood1</em>  team is a good, considering the low POC cost and their hunger to succeed.)</p>
<p>&#64;my NI rating manager and leadership in general - I just gave you the biggest callout of your life. My advise :</p>
<p>Respect <em>InternalSurvey</em> results.</p>
<p>Do what you are hired to do - geo strat based deal making should be the best lever.
If people are leaving.....linkedin leadership shares - you need to act.</p>
<p>It's all there in the motto - Dinosaurs etc.</p>
<p>Thanks for the ride and fuelling me with enough contempt to fire for next few years, thought I was burnt out.</p>
<p>Ashish</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>To the people who still like me - I am starting a new venture, will keep you posted via linkedin/codeparity.com(its on Gargle Workspace), or just reach out. I am on a quest to define IndianNess - We were and are quite capable of being sustainable. I have it planned like a suspense novel - It would be worth it - some shawshank stuff coming up - all from an underdog who came from nowhere and is absolutely expected to get burned (0% employment probability after this)</p>
<p>Dear manager(s) - This is what i told you about - &quot;Joker&quot; mode : a guy who has a bad day and turns the values of an institution against it, I hope you get it....and yes i have thought through - I &quot;know&quot; this.</p>
<p>Personal message to the leader who likes &quot;imagine dragons&quot; and &quot;pink floyd&quot; - poetic justice coming right up? .... <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_JF8oSxXtM">Motorhead Fan</a></p>
<p>On Googleness - This is the last bit of my duty to Gargle - I will not sue you - someone else may, gears are turning, and it would be beautiful - the hundreds of hours i wasted in explaining and justifying myself - it is going to multiply on you.</p>
<p>Time/efficiency is the real currency, not $$$ or account plans.</p>
