<p>hell - u get paid for it. so it becomes 'professional networking', not a kitty party... üòÅ </p>
<p>coz those stay at home moms - the veronicas are just 'evolved' superior and all those things.</p>
<p>it is a known phenomena : the sister-hood of veronicas has been an eternal mystery and yet a fact - the pretty girl exemplified with the betties..</p>
<p>a G opportunity : is everything...</p>

<p>while veronicas of world are running this 'genius and hidden' strat...</p>
<p>the gBaldies are baldies of G levels - for a reason...</p>
<p>the know how to hack 'wants' of veronica, so it becomes a need</p>
<p>and veronicas - they tend to not know the diff - need/want</p>
<p>coz veronicas-ness is an abstract quality - which starts reinforcing itself early</p>
<p>the school, kallege, pro life...marrying the 'l-user' who seems so much 'below'...</p>
<p>as time has progressed...</p>
<p>afterall - the sigmaness : of amit is what is desired...</p>
<p>all said and done...years pass...</p>
<p>the veronicas realize age and opportunities...are indirectly proportional</p>
<p>they make up mindblowers...</p>
<p>i deserve this, that and blah...</p>
<p>just to make sense of reality built on being 'chased' and 'showered'</p>

                <p>The 'spark' of an idea - a startup, an org, family - anything</p>
<p>the 'spark' is abstract...a thing, an approach - mostly a plan</p>
<p>which leads to some 'intent' being realized.</p>
<p>i dont want to make it fruity, but a spark is like a kid..</p>
<p>a kid which needs to be taught rules and life, progression and how it would age</p>
<p>It needs a family, which is 'true'</p>
<p>coz the 'intents' of this pseudo family, define the 'spark'</p>
<p>provide 'nutrition' and 'challenges'</p>
<p>to evolve with 'time' - age well</p>
<p>trust - in a family is the true ingridient</p>
<p>if trust is not there, the focus is not on kid, but on trust</p>
<p>the who did it, or why did it happen, or not happen</p>
<p>...the arguments - consume time</p>
<p>deplete trust</p>
<p>and hence no 'flow' or 'focus'</p>
<p>often the 'spark', this abstract kid, ends up being 'pimped' out</p>
<p>it is the culture - of success</p>
<p>money, being the win, fame and accolades of page 3 : stamp it 'nice'</p>
<p>be-coming early : the baldie phenomena of 90s genius</p>
<p>is a virus</p>
<p>it tells the entire ancestory - of the 'spark' : what was the 'price'</p>
<p>or the 'win' quantified as 'pimps' value it.</p>
<p>hence the life of spark...</p>
<p>a family after family, with different intents</p>
<p>and different be-coming early levels</p>
<p>capitalism at its finest : when money is the biggest religion, then inventions</p>
<p>can be buried with money and fame</p>
<p>patents : who never made it to mainstream production : nano tech, graphene etx</p>
<p>explicit examples of 'spark' being pimped out.</p>
<p>the money runs out : investments, cars , perception</p>
<p>...but like a parent, the spark is missed and regretted.</p>
<p>...ask the veronicas of the world...they 'win'.</p>

<p>i am saying 'veronicas' here, rather than amit...the init of this 'pimping' - is always with veronicas..</p>
<p>the kid needs a motherly figure...the 1 which is asked and equipped by nature : with feels and initial nutrition...it is the motherly instinct...assumed by law and socitia.</p>

<p>green peeps:</p>
<p>painted as calm/sane peeps</p>
<p>incest in hindu.exe, while the green areas are all 'holy' and 'peaceful'</p>
<p>while lurv to all : relationships are no bound for green.exe : just a prayer to popet and all is forgotten : coz living is misery, and their lives are a mission.</p>
<p>just the director is bollywodia &amp;&amp; green</p>
<p>his actors are green</p>
<p>and the cause of all this psy/op propoganda..</p>
<p>is just the end of meat factory called bollywood.</p>

<p>adreno - chrome : something which makes a pathaan swell up</p>
<p>or swell down..</p>
<p>there is no magic in all this...</p>
<p>just the proof : that a pretty young girl : salyan, can be butchered : without a trace in democraxy of britness </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>where the default father figure of amit bacchan, becomes all knowin/all wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yet a bihar born star - SSR, becomes an eternal suicide mystery, coz bollywoda and puulice and desi cia : all want to preserve 'green peace'</p>

</ul>
<p>are we free?</p>
<p>really?</p>
<p>the most popular/pretty/rich peeps : dissaper without a trace.</p>
<p>and yet : we have a rockin home minister who specialized in cutting ropes.</p>

<p>the weakness in green.exe : they want a 'khalifa' : the 1 to fear and pray to</p>
<p>their 90s khalifa : begging for pullice protection</p>
<p>their other khalifa : raising drug peddlers</p>
<p>the other : doing green things with other countries</p>
<p>these are rich green peeps..</p>
<p>they are khalifa of 5 footiya gym pumping pathaans...</p>
<p>they ll get a khalifa : just that it wont be 'green'...but orange üòÇ

<p>i already know the 'will' of bihar origin peeps : their 'son' and yet : silence.</p>
<p>there is a reason...being from bihar, or being a bihari is considered 'offensive' something to hide.</p>
<p>it is word : the self bias gives it a -ve meaning</p>
<p>bihariness : its upto biharis to prove the 'quality'</p>
<p>useless to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rooted in 'present' yet, cm is an opportunist, which will do morally compromising things - it is predictable</p>
<p>i left it after 2 episodes</p>
<p>cm yogi, would be back with a vengence, and it is predictable: he ll solve for it..</p>
<p>and then a film industry in UP...would solve for all the green bias.</p>
<p>this is going to happen, coz i know akumas.</p>

<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>all 'warring' gangs are 'hindu.exe'</p>
<p>the chump protagonist : goes from revenge to logic : power and its quest</p>
<p>logical peeps would ve collected habitus and went to some other country</p>
<p>but logic is not is green director..or his imagination</p>
<p>renaming green gangs to hindu, and making illogical masala stuff - hallmark of that dhakkan</p>

<p>confident peeps : born in comfort yet aware of the 'fall' : perception</p>
<p>title : defines what kinda choices they make : it should 'appear' in sync with 'title' : page 3 / instagram thing.</p>
<p>it is quite a protected upbringing : the fear of loses/hurt : to preserve ego and most importantly : the perception of success</p>
<p>titles are a real burden : if 1 is a private person.</p>

<p>well...baldies are programmed to 'enjoi' this season...</p>
<p>in a different way : bollywood</p>
<p>for wolfies...it means outdoors and activities..for this grey unkle...it just means less power interruptions üòÄ ..</p>
<p>but 90s baldies : gotta recommend something which they 'likey'...</p>
<p>behold : the superhit of 'monsoons/rains' ü§£ </p>

<p>i guess regional adaptations - UP/Bihar to cater to amit and mitesh - wont be 'decent'</p>
<p>but do try your imagination on youtube :  the great culture which makes proud 'state migrants' in other states...yet chased by green hyenas...</p>
<p>maybe the 'function' as defined by hindu.exe is just too - lame..</p>
<p>and hence we have 'leaders' from these 'states' whose leadership is hyena like.</p>
