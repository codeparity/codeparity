                <p>Sharing some closing thoughts on nearing the end of 0 journey.</p>
<p>When it started - i was absolutely clueless.</p>
<p>It dint make sense.</p>
<p>All i needed was emi and whatever familia required + 30k personal allowance</p>
<p>It was always there - from my first job.</p>
<p>Dad's hard work - did persist in material form.</p>
<p>In G, things are supposed to be 'secure'.</p>
<p>have to be - thats how people are able to innovate.</p>
<p>else, it is just survival.</p>
<p>I 'assumed'. </p>
<p>People getting paid more than enough, should make them feel 'secure' and do the duty - to every 'brand' they take from.</p>
<p>Corona, made things absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>People, hiding behind screen </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>doing the most 'illogical', yet inhumane things </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with fruity words and straight face.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I never encountered such beings. It was delusional - the peak of human intellect.</p>
<p>Thats like abnormal on psychological level.</p>
<p>Rationality, logic </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>never had a chance with baldies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thats not what their 'hiring' and leadership was based on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was based on 'leverage' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the indian version</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'things' which make people say yes - all kinds</p>
<p>Specially the CIO kinds </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the ones who are supposed to be 'logical' yet are 'stars' of cio magazine </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the creme da creme of peeps who were never engg enough to code</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just fanbois of kamputer engineering klub </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>of income, employment and a chance of escaping a country </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which humbles them by nos of engineers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So i tried - doing what a 'provider' is supposed to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>calculated the 'money vs time' thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how much betti 'needed' vs 'wanted' (she wanted a jeep, few foreign instagram posts, god of ai status - a lot of things. She was born better than me)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the kid - his needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dogs..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what i really wanted to do...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It came out to be a viable sum.</p>
<p>a quantified 'time' to bear baldies and all the familia stuff....</p>
<p>this 0, was quite bloated....computed quite a lot...in time and 'attention' and $$</p>
<p>the 2 years - a debug of 0.</p>
<p>which u now see realized.</p>
<p>the algos - are hard truth.</p>
<p>it happened for a 0 </p>
<ul>
<li>i think this is a 'corner' case - may not happen to anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>But would happen to anyone - if he doesn't 'understand'</p>
<p>Victimness - is the fashion.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a veronica/betti logix - i am better - i make the world go around. All peeps - nice to us. So i = better</p>
<p>A surname - is just a validation - a 'boundary' which this matriarchy of society - has been holding them back with...the kid (which they want) - but it should not mean 'leadersheep' kudos..</p>
<p>baldies know this - amits know this.</p>
<p>The father figure - vella of grade 1 with all the 'time' and wisdom...</p>
<p>has incentive - a worshipper in many ways.</p>
<p>a suv, few amits, a title, some recognition - of finally becoming a prom queen in professional life.</p>
<p>The nerd girl prototype and baldie relation..</p>
<p>G enius all around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any CIO feels offended or 'better", will be putting up 'blah blah hours' to do free consulting.</p>
<p>Free - my kind - it should be fun, if there is no $$. I like humoring CIOs - anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh - i dint apply to G - they sought me out.</p>
<p>It seemed good - money vs time thing</p>
<p>i was never really G desperate - all those startups i lost time on.</p>

                <p>Unkle comics : character introduction - a 'hurt' veronica</p>
<p>This is quite disturbing to even describe - kinda degrades the quality of unkle comics.</p>
<p>Yet, this character is the pawn - the energizer bunny who has a purpose - a hidden 1 ( power, lust - everything every napolean aims for ) - immortality via $</p>
<p>+powerup of fem, divorse and lack of respect which society 'awards u with'</p>
<p>The hidden purpose is well masked by combined intents of baldies.</p>
<p>for gAshish, this was so apparent, yet seemed intrusive enough to define this gBetti's purpose</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>destroy gAshish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mentally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verbally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reputation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>everything.</p>
<p>Debug:</p>
<p>this character is typical army brat cadre - surely borne by someone who never really went to a war, just served as some glorified clerk or some self serving yet badged baldie.</p>
<p>Being borne in fake values and entitlement, with a biological 0 - a fem, this betti had sees the world as its servant - civilians as they call it.</p>
<p>Problems being 5 footiya, not really pretti ( a veronica property ), this gCool strategi divorced/separated 'hack' of a betti wearing veronica brands could never really do 'hard work' aka logic.</p>
<p>When u have a leader like gAmit, logic is not really a priority </p>
<p>Amits' opener in most leader-sheep meets </p>
<ul>
<li>I am Amit, </li>
</ul>
<p>worked with MS </p>
<p>own a tesla</p>
<p>used to sell mac to giz bleh.</p>
<p>A match made in 'heaven'.</p>
<p>So this gVeronica alias gRuntProudArmy5footiyaNobodyDeservinglyDivorsedOnlyFans wanna be went beyond work - to take 'initiative'.</p>
<p>In all the assumed G - anus, this seemingly biological fem, exceeded all bounds of 'respect' and 'law'.</p>
<p>Feminism</p>
<p>Army Brat?</p>
<p>Proud??</p>
<p>🤣 </p>
<p>the gVeronica - sed lyf, she 'believed' </p>
<ul>
<li>afterall fems are always truthful to fems 😂 </li>
</ul>
<p>// see - we leave no 'relationships' behind - inclusivity of brother/sisterhood and their corp version - fem fem clubs.</p>

<p>contradictions of feminism, 'leaders', their 'success' and hence veronicas' success</p>
<p>I maybe just making stuff up.</p>
<p>..my habitus only being a very .0001% of 'experiences' of total cumulative genius of mankind and combined experiences/ knowledge..</p>
<p>Technology, makes lives simple - for most part.</p>
<p>We are in an era, where tech as or would make humans obsolete </p>
<ul>
<li>so really the 'incentive' to read and analyze history is not there.</li>
</ul>
<p>also, it is not $ supported.</p>
<p>Veronica - with all humility and respect, actually end up becoming 'not so a leader' by amits.</p>
<p>It is impossible.</p>
<p>It never happens.</p>
<p>Opportunities are there - but history itself produces leverage and trust of inverted kinds.</p>
<p>Afterall - every alfred job is an invisible cockroach jar, now global and more public....</p>
<p>The bigger question for me, and an eternal mystery for veronicas - do they really needed amit?</p>
<p>or amit makes veronicas?</p>
<p>or a veronica makes amits?</p>
<p>there might be many 'opinions' here, but occums' razor </p>
<ul>
<li>considering page 3 capitalistic requirements and 'intelligence' required to 'narrate' unkle charles khwaab's eurakaas....</li>

<p>would veronica ever find a meta verse where she could know her 'purpose' ?</p>
<p>or </p>
