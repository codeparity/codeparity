<p>i see maths as a rather indirect approach to debugging...</p>
<p>it makes patterns and wonders if those patterns created reality?</p>
<p>it is a bottom up approach</p>
<p>physics is a top down approach - the intent which created maths.</p>
<p>so maths is a tool to make sense of physics, not otherwise.</p>
<p>no wonder i never really mugged it...it verifies the 'debug' </p>
<p>the 'intent' comes from real physics.</p>

<p>service based businesses...the hallmark of this kind of baldie</p>
<p>it is just a glorified accounting service...with mules of engineering available in plenty - lots of clones of model kamputer programmer</p>
<p>the brand / baldie : remains - the mules come and go</p>

                <p>The 'spark' of an idea - a startup, an org, family - anything</p>
<p>the 'spark' is abstract...a thing, an approach - mostly a plan</p>
<p>which leads to some 'intent' being realized.</p>
<p>i dont want to make it fruity, but a spark is like a kid..</p>
<p>a kid which needs to be taught rules and life, progression and how it would age</p>
<p>It needs a family, which is 'true'</p>
<p>coz the 'intents' of this pseudo family, define the 'spark'</p>
<p>provide 'nutrition' and 'challenges'</p>
<p>to evolve with 'time' - age well</p>
<p>trust - in a family is the true ingridient</p>
<p>if trust is not there, the focus is not on kid, but on trust</p>
<p>the who did it, or why did it happen, or not happen</p>
<p>...the arguments - consume time</p>
<p>deplete trust</p>
<p>and hence no 'flow' or 'focus'</p>
<p>often the 'spark', this abstract kid, ends up being 'pimped' out</p>
<p>it is the culture - of success</p>
<p>money, being the win, fame and accolades of page 3 : stamp it 'nice'</p>
<p>be-coming early : the baldie phenomena of 90s genius</p>
<p>is a virus</p>
<p>it tells the entire ancestory - of the 'spark' : what was the 'price'</p>
<p>or the 'win' quantified as 'pimps' value it.</p>
<p>hence the life of spark...</p>
<p>a family after family, with different intents</p>
<p>and different be-coming early levels</p>
<p>capitalism at its finest : when money is the biggest religion, then inventions</p>
