                <p>gAshish - flashback </p>
<p>what made this a 'priority' thing - whooping gAmit and general baldies..</p>
<p>some 6-7 months back...</p>
<p>paw baldie was getting to 'execution'...</p>
<p>or atleast 'prototyping' stuff...</p>
<p>space was 'needed'...</p>
<p>but no 'fren' or 'partner' seem to help....</p>
<p>so paw went online - rent a space....</p>
<p>weird thing - phone dint seem to work</p>
<p>voice over wifi - failed me...</p>
<p>weird...no 'incoming'...from 'new' nos...</p>
<p>cant talk to brokers...swapped phones...</p>
<p>no change...</p>
<p>kinda indicated some 'survillance'</p>
<ul>
<li>the phone virus implant strategei must ve failed...</li>
</ul>
<p>so some baldie must ve made out some 'allegations'...</p>
<p>which may have put paw under 'surveillance'...</p>
<p>paw knows tech - doesnt have to 'copycat' like g_baldies...</p>
<p>all it took was time and some strategei </p>
<ul>
<li>countering the 'born genius sold out' betti ....</li>
</ul>
<p>that was few months back...</p>
<p>and now the feel of 'home' is here...</p>
<p>so we chill and execute...</p>
<p>cox - it never seemed like 'work' to me...</p>
<p>born for it?</p>
<p>naah - i was born to play fighting games...</p>
<p>strategies - all hacked from there...</p>
<p>kinda random, yet realtime...</p>
<p>who hacked who baldies? 🤣 </p>
<p>...just a reminder </p>
<ul>
<li>peeps should ve realized who 'blah blah' was, and can become....</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess the most imp requirement for a leader or a relative manger  - be a bigger person</p>
<p>it seems simple - but if your boss is unworthy, absolute failure of engineer, spent his professional stinky toilets of sarkari banks - befriending clerks by lures of respect, lust or money...</p>
<p>it makes sense g_baldies[] got 'insecure' and 'jealous' - the 2 prime feels of sigmaness/title...</p>
<p>it ended up being a peeing contest...even now...</p>
<p>coz verronicca - and her 'what if' momets - may haunt gAmit...making him act sigma++ to regain the feels of murd++ of corp env - the ultimate father figure...</p>
<p>this is googley?</p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not suing - hence this...had justification on weird layers..</p>
<p>it is a hindu thing...never hurt the hand that feeds you...</p>
<p>it is weird - though it was a hellhole - it did provide for kid and all that i needed at that time..</p>
<p>so moving on with no regrets seemed good - considering the ideas which i had formed over this 'testy' journey of blind savagery - all by beggars of $</p>
<p>but then, baldies and egos cant really handle the 'truth' as told in those googley resig and farewell mails...</p>
<p>..if u tell peeps as leader - that gAshish was perv, nobody and hits on veronica coz for some strange reason - veronica likes working with gAshish?</p>
<p>it became a mission of sorts for them. sadly i think veronica became a mute victim in this - taking 'blah blah' down and putting him in his hindu-ism place of 'worthiness'..</p>
<p>she must ve been 'promised' primeness...title money page 3 etx.</p>

<li>
<p>buy food</p>

<p>buy fuel/oil/electric</p>

<p>==&gt; Belief in govt/leader makes it 'good/progress'</p>
<p>===&gt; CN is a worldwide example of 'progress' and communism - the unholy wedding of $ and CN</p>
<p>Next phase - make CN model global</p>
<p>Immigration friendly countries CA/AU </p>
<ul>
<li>seem to be just few steps behind CN 'like' 'non commie democratic' govt - power to peeps kind</li>

<p>Even 'imaginary $' seem to have a real 'cost'...when it comes back to $ gods - the brit/us bankers...</p>
<p>now they have to 'pay' back in effort or material....</p>
<p>but they cant....</p>
<p>so bank closures....more and many incoming....</p>
<p>Lots of technicalities here...</p>

<p>Kiran being 'deceived' by Mightest</p>
<p>Amit sobbing like a hurt barbie, or turning into an aggressive, yet neutered sigma bull.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to let java peeps know - there is hope...</p>
<p>yes, from lumpa limpis of 'engineering' - you can 'break the sandbox/matrix' too 😂 </p>
<p>God is with you - walk into the 'light'...let the lust/illusion of no memory sucker you in...</p>
<p>memory is real - ask the tuning guys who earn more salaries than coder to make the stickly not.exe run...</p>
<p>and the misery of peeps who go to deployment, oh the helplessness of compiling a jar of deps and finally packaging it enough to run from "shell" - challenging its cmd line limits...</p>
<p>yes, its is barbie world for 'engineering barbies' ...the softness - is just too comfy 😘

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 has to understand the genius of this bleah blah ...</p>
<p>the 'filing'/legal considerations - before establishing an imaginary link - of unklecomics/delusional guy....</p>
<p>is kinds of funny...</p>
<p>even the guy appointed by baldies to keep track of these stories - cant help 'enjoying them'...</p>
<p>a virus of wit - big boss. 😂 </p>
