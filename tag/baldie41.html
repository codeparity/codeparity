<p>This all started with an assignment at sharjah - the so called peak of 'abdul/oil' world</p>
<p>a man standing alone in desert - on a road, just watching the road - seemed Indian</p>
<p>I watched the strangeness for few days - there were many - all seeming to be watching, yet doing nothing - heat, dust, fast cars - everything</p>
<p>later, i was told that these guys are 'human dustbins' - they pick up the 'stuff' thrown from cars....</p>
<p>happened to talk to 1 of them - no passport, no money - 10 years of promise of a 'good' life...</p>
<p>and there i was - from same land - using my 'humor' on clueless abduls at a 'sat' company</p>
<p>Rs10k - he wasnt even making that much....2007</p>
<p>progress?</p>
<p>or serving some abduls cox they buy white robes for black ?

<p>The 'elite' abduls of this land - who change their headgear to hide the baldie - they do run their 'binary_search()' too - albeit a 'genius' 1</p>
<p>Indian - he must be 'subserviant'</p>
<p>place him in a 'appropriate' labor class hotel...</p>
<p>talk to him like he reports to you...</p>
<p>take his passport....</p>
<p>had to bash in few 50 iq intellects to get the assignment done</p>

<p>money was good - got offered a job - 25L a month - but then...money never really a thing - it was the freking concrete desert with fake $$ and its admirers everywhere...</p>
<p>it seemed like selling time/life....</p>
<p>desi 0 alfreds in making - they think this is "success" - was amazed at convinience of this self proclaimed BJP bhakt - how quickly he turned his back for $$

                <p>Angels/Demons and their 3d ways </p>
<ul>
<li>absolutely delusional abdul like take.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Hinduism - you can be born a 'Dev'(god being) or 'Daitya'(devil being)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is 1 or the other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pundits may do their numerical magic - defy the % in which the balance of 3d universe lies - both are needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>balance</p>
<p>Good/Bad</p>
<p>i really dont know absolute good or bad.</p>
<p>people try, then  hindsight makes people and prophets look 'genius'</p>
<p>I am trying to understand this boundary of good|bad</p>
<p>In nihilism - it is meaningless - just a body's desires as decided by reality and lure of 'feelings' based half of brain - akin to $$++</p>
<p>In medieval times - material might - abduls rules</p>
<p>in 'modern' times - logical might - alfreds rule.</p>
<p>No one can define 'progress' </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>rightfully claim 'good' </p>
<p>unless they cite the holy book or religion </p>
<ul>
<li>the wrongs done by some neanderthal as written by another neanderthal - all near to monkey intellect - $ science tells us that.</li>
</ul>
<p>holy books are not just religion - they are the rule books</p>
<p>name changes, intent doesnt</p>
<p>-religion in medieval times</p>
<p>-science in 'industrialized times'</p>
<p>-'education' in current 'peak' times</p>
<p>all that blah blah - to pose some Q's</p>
<p>who can define good and bad?</p>
<p>leaders know?</p>
<p>preachers/influencers/karma deciders - do they know?</p>
<p>i dont think anyone knows anything - the maya or matrix is 1s understanding and relevance in matrix</p>
<p>just like the hypothetical 'devil/shaitaan/daitya' manifests itself via its hacks - lust, gluttony etc</p>
<p>God, would manifest itself in similar ways - the hacks - temptation to devil.</p>
<p>As above - so below.</p>
<p>all this is known, yet forgotten - newton, karma, nature : it is a universal fact -  each religion agrees.</p>
<ul>
<li>devil and his hacks seem to have executed a DDOS via glam, shimmer, success....</li>
</ul>
<p>the null pointer - i think it manifests in certain conditions....in every habitus.</p>
<p>i gave examples of g_baldie_1 - someone who lost his pointer to 'good' in 'society'</p>
<p>the other 1, of God manifesting itself </p>
<ul>
<li>is when we can really 'work' - free of bias, fear and everything</li>
</ul>
<p>i feel everyone knows this feeling...maybe work, hobby, music or just someone's company.</p>
<p>Dido - the unofficial angel of this hypothetical religion </p>
<ul>
<li>she becomes an angel when she performs/inspires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i dont think the 'feeling' comes from a human - just via a human.</p>
<p>did she need to do yoga or subscribe to antics of iron man? 😀 </p>
<p>she knows her 1s and it shows.</p>
<ul>
<li>her journey is interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>i think she was 'discovered' when she tried to 'steal' a musical instrument - the start of a 0</p>
<p>Tx and tc.</p>

                <p>How does a 50+ "revered/respected industry figure" "transition"?</p>
<p>can he resign?</p>
<p>$$ needs real brains - not the applauds of genius from cockroach jar</p>
<p>-cant resign, algo is stuck on perception</p>
<p>what 'ppl would think 😮 '</p>
<p>search for 'opportunities' - title++ &amp;&amp;|| $++</p>
<p>-being a booger makes u sticky, 'popular' and 'accountable.</p>
<p>keep positive 😁 </p>
<p>ask other 90s genius - to 'counsel'</p>
<p>money, reputation - all at stake...even legacy - welcome to a 0, and 0-- journey.</p>
<p>too many words - we are 'here' </p>
<ul>
<li>😡 </li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;🤑</p>
<p>==&gt; 😶</p>
<p>Inspiring? </p>
<p>absolutely I am really "inspired" - 100x 0rakle, hcI, lbm etx - all made to live this - forever,  100x vs 'stray'.</p>
<p>2024 - will be free from baldies - hyenas cant function till a 'leader' is selected...and now there is no puppa - for 100x booglies.</p>
<p>impact - a memorable 2023 - it is real 'value' for 365 days - once a lifetime adventure. 😂 </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i was a real 'bully' in some aspects - i 'liked' it, even had a 'gang' of bullies...</p>
<p>it was still based in 'merit' - of ability - being streetwise and able</p>
<p>gave it up to follow alfred path...the alfred path which seems to make a bully = leader</p>
<p>it is not that black and white...experience teaches u that...</p>
<p>having the 'right' relative reasons makes intent++, no resistance in body/mind -&gt; hence intents</p>
<p>dexter to 50+ baldies is not something to 'like'...</p>
<p>the insight is really in mindset of a bully - how few seconds or words of assumed inflated ego perceived 'disrespect'....multiply and double up like an addicted gambler algo....</p>
<p>i know me - used that 'knowledge' to tame the experienced gBullies - now maybe xooglers,  many in making.</p>
<p>all avoidable, if bullies really knew - now it is indelible, unforgettable, unrepeatable - their peak is now their worst memory </p>
<p>very Shakespearean - brit masters would be proud 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>choices - forced on me...</p>
<p>ridiculed, timed - the baldies did their 'best' as per their intellect - call cia, Private investigators, everything possible via g$$ and genius perception of 100x poodles.</p>
<p>now - all caught up in his own lies - graceful? cant say, but he 'deserves' much much more - the $ pattern - the snakie which goes 0 to N - till infinity =&gt; no contribution to society, just i/o operation as per 'gDepravity"</p>
<p>% is still due.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recap - what a brand is </p>
<ul>
<li>it is value and perception</li>
</ul>
<p>baldies borrowed it - build their future on it - as a base layer</p>
<p>'googlers' - the word ppl would get engraved on their tomb stones - if society allowed it 😀 </p>
<p>what paw did here is simple - challenged the brand and perception of 'having the best'</p>
<p>they dont have the 'best' - cant keep it</p>
<p>brand--, company-- = perception = $ value</p>
<p>no products in line - just more 'promises' of success.</p>
<p>value was created - it was taken from the brand and its admirers</p>
<p>value, which should follow 'newtons' law of emotions'
</p>
