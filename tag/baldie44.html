<p>The thing about doing something this 'ridiculous' is simple - a religion which already decides what u can and would do - as decided by 'pundits' in my religion...</p>
<p>i ve given a royal salute to all of them - already...</p>
<p>a father really succeds when his son 'likes' the foundation - he should be able to 'build' on it.</p>
<p>i am not about leaving fake inheritance, if few baldies are in way - their problem - mug more books..... i am more about we are born 'able', made dependent by 'genius'</p>

<p>same pattern - different names. </p>
<p>Paw is an object of CodeParity, it has the 'choice' of choosing his 'words' and skills.</p>
<p>it is not a bondage of $ time bound $$ dependent 'festivals' - just asking some Qs to urself - and your 'God' answers. </p>

<p>abduls - feeling the 'time' of revelation, the 'time' of abdul unleashed is here now!!</p>
<p>if  you = new CodeParity(), it has abstract functions of 'year' - you define it, not let tv, news and religion define it...</p>
<p>typeid(CodeParity)  has freedom to 'time' it - do it when it 'rhymes' - $$ is less, and less noise.</p>

<p>any programmer would consider these 2 phases quite intuitive and logical</p>

<p>2 years to make sure 42 years dont become a pattern - sick of my pattern in ppl, trust and shiny things.</p>
<p>Bigger things to come</p>
<p>some more googley comms.</p>
<p>to g_baldie_1</p>
<p>g_karela</p>

<p>to make it even more ambiguous/clear</p>
<p>alfred : just 'times' his 'abdul'ness : most of the times = alfred : master's sheep</p>
<p>abdul : 'times' his 'alfredness' for doing 'gods work' = minimum wage = life is cruel, ppl are bad, society -- , most midlife crisis ppl like me 😂 </p>
<p>a ppl is made of abduls and alfreds - it is the 'time' and 'layer' of existence which 'choses' which 1 you will 'embody' or point to...</p>

                <p>A lot of pappus techCheetas habitus ppl .... seem to be becoming 'nicer'...</p>
<p>the g_baldies[] example seems to cause some 'impact' 😁 </p>
<p>they 'assume' something...i dont assume anything....hacking at this 'level' requires walking few fine lines - undetectable by 70 iq genius.</p>
<p>The "impact" has been due for some decades </p>
<p>....music connects you to people you never can know...its not fandom...it is an intersection of 0s</p>
<p>Chester Bennington/ Linkin Park is a rabbit hole in itself....</p>
<p>the 'feelings' in those compositions is 'raw, unadulterated'</p>
<p>those who felt their 0, would know ... </p>
<p>page 3 ppl miss the subtle notes while posing for the selfie....</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5G - seems to be a touchy subject...as a former telecom/satcom engg....it is not about the protocols, the air interface and all - it is all good, shall lead to better connectivity..</p>
<p>the devil is in the frequencies...wifi/2g made 'official sparrows' dissapear from delhi...yet no genius would 'spot' it...</p>
<p>sar, frequency absorption, trees - they all form an ecosystem which needs much study before allocation...the frequency range is a problem...as are the alleged graphene particles in vax, good alfred food etc..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>music - healing - peace - physical healing  - all seem connected...solfeggio frequencies is real, proven science - yet hidden, with no one making anything on it...</p>
<p>wont take much..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Codeparity 0s - december anthem...</p>
<p>lets make a family of good musicians - if Linkin park is the 'fuel'...then Dido should be an angel of unofficial religion of codeparity...</p>
<p>just timeless good music...from the real 90s.</p>
