                <p>The "Key"</p>
<p>To debug yourself:</p>
<p>Understand and quantify the "emotion"</p>
<p>eg - right now </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why this guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does he ever work...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the emotion - curiosity, hate, lurv etc</p>
<p>and i am all those things üòÄ </p>
<ul>
<li>but lets make it about "debugging"</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did 1 feels that - the reason and logic is the key</p>
<p>the thought process goes like this</p>
<p>hate</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i hate his face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate cox a 0 cannot be "right" - brand always is "company, religion, leader etc"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate the "disrespectful-ness"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to sum it up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pause, take a breath</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask the "why"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>see - no going to a "quiet" place or "being holy" and all -effienet and hacky as you would like it - engages - the Neo brain (conscious thinking) over impulse.</p>
<p>As an engineer - understanding "why" - to the level of perception i have - was satisfying.</p>
<p>The logic "whys" - the layers to which 1 can debug himselves - the bigger Neo he becomes (Neo-cortex) something which evolves vs the very physical, literal lizard brain we all have.....</p>
<p>//he is delusional , still why i am i reading this??</p>
<p>// ask the "why"</p>

<p>I ll give a g_baldie_1 and general g_baldies[] example</p>
<p>to "solve" for g_baldies[]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>understand the "why"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observe the "why" - as time goes - deltas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>observe the change in "whys"</p>

<p>the answer in low iq $ world - is just $ </p>
<p>then what they do with it </p>
<p>g_baldies[] buy teslas üòÅ </p>
<p>their glasses really go "golden"</p>
<p>the tone - authoritative</p>
<p>logic - non explainable - just ppl and their past "high scores"</p>
<p>then - go hack - at any layer</p>
<p>i ll use the $ game and its "knowledge" </p>
<p>what ppl do with it...</p>
<p>sometimes, it is just sad - a g_baldie_1 craving for fame, emotion - never had in school, college, pro_life - ever</p>
<p>now - u got "nice" women - going all üòÇ üòÇ </p>
<p>and aww - the 1" intellectual thing - the rockstar / pink floydm  logging it out - corp version of "angst" - highs, which may be "unconquered" if humble leaders like us, dont make time to play "Comfortably numb" - at 6:00 PM - friday evening </p>

<p>Sometimes - atleast for me - there was a time - 10-13 years ago...when the "why"s stopped calming me down</p>
<p>that was the time - the doc was really needed - the rage was just whack - autoimmune disease - in a different form</p>
<p>an unsolved nutritional/cultural "why" which the doctors, leaders of the world - never debugged, just accepted.</p>

<p>took "hate" as example - a general observation on "likeys" vs reads</p>
<p>nihilism - the roots of codeparity are in reality - not in some philosophical or real creature</p>

<p>skill - or power - can be gained or hacked</p>

<p>One of the "disrespectful" or mini dharma lessons are learnt in arcade/streets in my days:</p>
<p>In arcade - the age/size dint matter - it was the joystick and buttons which anyone can press - or get skilled at</p>
<p>As the kid who found this fascinating -  a whiz kid at video games ..but consequences were real, in streets...baldies..and their egoes...</p>
<p>It dint matter then - kinda became local legend in local arcade circles.</p>
<p>The lessons remained - some ppl live that life - Daigo, Tokido, Momochi and they excel - inspire</p>

<p>What if these ppl were the "insiders"?</p>
<p>will they hire to carry on "white collar crimes" or grey corp/capitalistic espionage ?</p>
<p>I think they do, it explains why they will hire "baldies" with "decades" old experience - the "data" is the gold.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the cloud game - full of out of date baldies - who sold "boxes"</p>
<p>suddenly they are needed at "cloud leadership"</p>
<p>none of these guys can really explain cloud to a newbie engineer - they never used it - only preach it.</p>
<p>the pnb thing - hiring of the orakle leadership - was due to their in-prem deployment. GOI forbade cloud in banking long ago - still "detailed account plans" are needed by baldie alfred</p>
<p>i dont think even he knew- he was busy chasing his "golden" bone out of country which treated his as per his "aukaat"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cloud is a "apps" thing - roi/risk is manageable</p>
<p>the "enterprise" part - someone running those servers at superior bandwith, with less cost (discounts etc)</p>
<p>sometimes the discounts wont even justify the "electric cost"</p>
<p>but, they are offered = "strategically"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I dint learn it on purpose - i was on "receiving" end of it.</p>
<p>Always trying to "reverse engineer" - I dint react as i was expected to....initially i did, but you learn</p>
<p>it becomes increasingly evident - the internal "broadcast messaging" - they things, portfolios, the kind of companies/assets they are after....telecom/banking are the "highest" priority, then the nihilistic layers - water, land, agri, electric - whatever the host govt would "allow" them to do</p>
<p>colorado usa - they destroyed a whole city, a river with countless animals to set up the "cloud farms"</p>
<p>yet, the 'news' is their 'fren' so you ll never hear it</p>
<p>just how "big tech" cares - planted trees, green campus and glory...</p>
