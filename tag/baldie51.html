                <p>OSINT &amp;&amp; BlahBlah - a module for Sheep/Wolves - "the booger wars"</p>
<p>/*</p>
<p>blahBlah = a former booger employee, brandished - 'non-performer' aka "not as good"/ "Needs Improvement" etc</p>
<p>blahBlah, being very 'improving' - self beating kinds...took it seriously</p>
<p>worked through the self bias, dark night of soul blah and all</p>
<p>it worked.</p>
<p>so blahBlah went to work - logic and execution</p>
<p>this was 2 years back</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>blahBlah was a bully too - in another life, before "duties" took over</p>
<ul>
<li>wolf...of kinds...</li>
</ul>
<p>*/</p>
<p>Now Blah Blah does "Blah Blah" - only pointing out "inconsistencies" in the way of "masters"</p>
<p>well - the master kind of took "an initiative" to brandish blahBlah as "non complaint sheep"</p>
<p>They were right, just that blahBlah wasnt sheep to begin with.</p>
<p>Time - the only thing which eluded blahBlah, due to the circus of "genius ppl" who were "duties" at that time, place.</p>
<p>Time is a wonderful thing. </p>
<p>The very thing which defines "life".</p>
<p>Yet, every pup born or unborn - has his "time" precalculated for him - education, competition - jobs, spouse, cars, sheep++</p>
<p>Time allows you to discern, take a step back .... just to get a perspective of why blahBlah started playing this "circus" without even knowing it....</p>
<p>Science - seems stalled since WW2</p>
<p>Computers - should have "accelerated" innovation</p>
<p>Genome decode - should have atleast cured "headaches" or pimples</p>
<ul>
<li>it just doesnt make sense - inventing ai to replace "us", when "us" is no where near perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>all that blahBlah, is just snake talk...</p>
<p>we talk about baldie vengence... it is real.</p>
<p>so baldie hcI 0rackle fame never understood "brand"</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it tells a lot about ppl - being "indian" is a brand too - do they use it, or give it back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a 70 iq genius baldie, way past his expiry date - due to his attitude, is bound to overestimate his "genius" - no sense of "value", just money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so he assimiliated his hcI bretren - to echo the version of "genius" they ran</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it becomes "truth or GValues"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gThanks amongst this new "bretren" of genius -defines a new culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is barking at cows at his point - the older ones mooed -while hyenas took over - there was no hope.</p>
<p>the surrender of values.</p>
<p>a lot of words were said.</p>
<p>One kind of triggered blahBlah - 'aukat'</p>
<p>It is a very crude way of asking someone of his "worth".</p>
<p>No matter how much blahBlah hated it, this word has hounded him forever - since long.</p>
<p>There was the real enemy.</p>
<p>Now cut to 2023, the high of baldies is over.</p>
<p>The "brand" pimping done by the erstwhile respectable baldies is being "unpeeled" at various layers - something genius level nepotistic iq baldies never realized</p>
<p>What to do?? Spanking is coming from the alfred above??</p>
<p>Hire a third party.</p>
<p>Find the "hacks" in blahBlah - welcome to try.</p>
<p>Just a 'namaste' to "brand management"</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the joker.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>one which is at peak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one which is at 0 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>0 is unknown - exists on paper, but not in a capitalistic world</p>
<p>G is at peak - it wont get any better ( informed rats are already fleeing)</p>
<p>0 is not even known.</p>
<p>I dint like money</p>
<p>for me, it seems to bring out worst in them.</p>
<p>Something which is "good" for someone, but "bad" for everyone.</p>
<p>No, no amount of "checks" to "developing" countries will undo the plastic crap you ppl end up manufacturing.</p>
<p>eg "googlers" - the fart smelling group on "Big Tech"</p>
<p>that smart - that they invented have free energy?</p>
<p>Free Internet?</p>
<p>Free Food?</p>
<p>Oh, they can do all thatt - but they are slaves who have to fondle the shriveled nuts of shwab, soros, wef, bis or whatever psy/op "intellectually superior" huddle some people have created for themselves.</p>
<p>No leaders.</p>
<p>No gods.</p>
<p>No alfreds.</p>
<p>Big words - you bet.</p>
<p>4 years?</p>
<p>maybe less?</p>
<p>maybe delusional?</p>
<p>I have been all my life - baldies kept telling me that.</p>
<p>i cant spot any baldies now - they dont like me.</p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason.</p>
<p>Everything starts with a "paw"!</p>
<p>I finally found a way to unload the "psy op intellectual crap" that explains the so called "matrix"</p>
<p>will "time" it with v v "hacky" but logical and explainable values - layers</p>
<p>till then....i told u what u need to know.</p>
<p>Apologies if blah blah bothered you </p>
<p>Now, i create 🙂  </p>

<p>.....</p>
<p>boring ....they tried, they keep trying...</p>
<p>The pattern, the weakness, the history...the hack.</p>
<p>A joker is a good one when he is "random"</p>
<p>a brick is trained to think corp version of "outside the box"</p>
<p>sometimes, the solution is <the box>!!</p>
<p>Indians are good at "googleys" - it aint your thing...keep losing those invisible hair 😀 </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for the uninitiated, and still intrigued - the real reason i havent been sued till now...is not a mystery but a real life check-mate of sorts</p>
<p>if they sue me, i being a 0, get "noticed"</p>
<p>i have the docs</p>
<p>the docs lead to a slew of "intelligent" ppl, in sarkari banks, in global mnc, etc - who have normalized selling info as their "value" in the "market"</p>
<ul>
<li>similar to bank scammer/callers who hold your info, keep a tab on your financial run ins/issues and are helpful to sweep in your time of needs </li>
</ul>
<p>same thing, just that instead of phone numbers, the incompetence of these ppl is captured on those documents</p>
<p>i was supposed to be a scrape goat - to feed the punjabi/pakistani - superior race / intelligent worthy ppl</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>not done, actually...now i get started. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in computational terms - distributed systems scale well</p>
<p>consensus, in a human society is a product of mass awareness- consciousness </p>
<p>the psy hack of "feelings" which validate "a version of success" is "unsaid mass consensus"</p>
<p>$$ is absolutely useless to me...but it serves a purpose, a hack</p>
<p>a hack which validates a conflicting idea...suddenly becomes "likeable"</p>
<p>i would share my "gestalt" ...but it needs to be earned...else it would be as useless as blah blah done on this baldies and alfreds - who are an "example" in this live exercise of "merit" or "idea"</p>
<ul>
<li>i make it interesting to keep it engaging for me...it is a pattern for me now, they just dont know how many "invisible" baldies lie in my path...already..just an observation</li>
</ul>
<p>narcissist/delusional....lets judge after 4+ years....</p>
<p>judgement is best used on rich, powerful, alfreds and masters...but its a cockroach world, aint it?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>anything....but 1 thing is for sure, truth resonates more with $$ and as you "googlers" know - i have a mouth and skills to back it up...</p>
<p>should be "excited"!! a brave new world!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gaming?</p>
<p>free/sustainable energy?</p>
<p>gyan guru?</p>
<p>independent director?</p>
<p>???
