                <p>"Indian" in CEOs</p>
<p>this is latest - after banning a world renowned doctor, it is an "Indian" which is at the receiving end of youtube's morality policing.</p>
<p>Context : an Indi video creator - called "String"'s content was banned and taken down.</p>
<p>String creates content to bring out true/factual history of India</p>
<p>(minus pathans and their time travel inventions, and british master's manifestation of toilet paper)</p>
<p>Anything which builds confidence of Indian native population is extremely problematic to Indian alfreds who milk the "indian" label to beg for those jobs.</p>
<p>Pichai/Kerala boot polish cloud - i wrote to all about the theft of "hacker paradise" - "detailed account plans" - ip addresses, phone of personnel, os, versions, lan org, nat, firewall vendors</p>
<p>yeah - they are tail wagging poodles - so are the 70 iq elite muggers of world - "googlers"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the amount of internal "psy op" you get to bear in this "fruity" company is amazing....the genius ppl in HR, trying to understand technology and its intricacies ðŸ˜‚ </p>
<p>then they have to "pretend" they care...while 'leaders' instruct them to 'bury' the matter to get a fat promotion or "thanks" of some kind...</p>
<p>how they ll use "stress" as an "in" to declare anything which discredits you - allegations of worst kind ( even ridiculous - like some divorsed lady being "harassed" when she call me at 11 pm.....why...i had it recorded...knew the snakies....that too...in lockdown corona times..)</p>
<p>the reaction of "on my side" "people-ops" lady was amazing when i told her that i talked to a lawyer....she flipped..</p>
<p>it was like a hitman missed his shot...the "settlement" - well she knew the answer to that...</p>
<p>toxic is "understatement" - will write about it some day - actually they did make me document all that...will just share when the "time" is right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WEF publishes "principles" of new world - call it DEI.</p>
<p>BlackRubbles/Assguards of the world - mandate it - under DEI, compliance/climate change etc</p>
<p>Indian/Alien doesnt matter - they are labels to sway a large growing market - a "pleasing" face which defends pedos</p>
<p>As Indian as Gandhi or Rahul ji - product, produce of the same tail wagging ecosystem
</p>

<p>a joker doesnt play 'duhai' game in a court - my life wont be a result of mediocrity of few alfreds - god knows many baldies have tried</p>

<p>I think a lot of ppl on linkedin aspire to work for BigTech someday...</p>
<p>yeah - maybe u will </p>
<p>either you skill up so no "genius" can defy logic or manners</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>you find a professional sugar daddy in one of these companies</p>
<p>there is no other way - best real advise u would never find anywhere</p>
<p>I never really cared...i thought i would...but then i dint</p>
<p>gaming - thats where future is - wef says so.</p>

<p>Purpose thing is real....else i would be wagging my stray tail to boomer baldies and their HCL/Oraclite hall of fame of wisdom...</p>
<p>and the "leaders" of the world would be liking "vax, esg, dei" and your/my kid...would already be theirs - in mental and maybe in physical sense - true Orwellian fantasy realized in CA by fentynl and these "geniuses" who are insecure to burn 18 hours in office - to scheme and plot their "empires"</p>
<p>....the kids would rather like a dad/mom with a big house/car..</p>
<p>yours might - my wont. </p>
<p>no one is genius enough to say this - i will.</p>
<p>btw - the level of question at booglie cloud : which port does a dns server run on??</p>
<p>wow - the ppl who made search engine asking memory based question...</p>
<p>it seems "genius" but how else would you get in your hcl intellect ppl in?</p>
<p>that too selected via casteism/nepotism...</p>
<p>it works when there is no work.</p>

<p>"leaders", googlers and "role-models" - for weak willed, unskilled, greedy - future newbie alfreds.</p>
<p>The essential part of last 18 months was - i did not want to deal with these ppl </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>degrades my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fighting with pigs in mud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for money, fame - 2 of the most limiting things when u want to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a general assault on physical senses of sight, hearing and 'logic'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;lose time and energy - genius level tail wagging comps.</p>
<p>the "brand" is mud now. Google will be going downhill from now on - eu/brics ...u ll see.</p>
<p>I ll do my part - the mail has all the names, verbal lying recordings and a lot of "other stuff" </p>
<ul>
<li>so lets be done with "genius booglers" - light that fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not new - the out of warranty oldies and their ego massaging alfreds have crossed my path, only to find out the significance of "Tanwar" ðŸ™‚ </p>
<p>The game could have been over the day i resorted to lowest layers of existence - nihilism - i came from it. </p>
<p>Subtle things which you realize when u have outplayed it - the game is as good as the opponent - a defeat is a win if the opponent has skills which you admire - helps you imbibe them.</p>
<p>A game with fake leaders and their psychological/virtual/real offsprings has no win for me.</p>
<p>I took time to debug myself - last 20 years changed something in my psych, the silence which was there when i needed it, was not there.</p>
<p>I couldn't enjoy coding - my initial "feeling" when i chose CS as career.</p>
<p>The answer was much deeper and it took time.</p>
<p>Money perverted my motivations in ways that it was too subtle to debug.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to pinpoint the reason - the tools, the ide, the os, or the hardware or me.</p>
<p>It took some time, and now we are back. </p>
<p>Lets play our own game now, shall we?</p>
<p>A win has a proud feeling to it - it feels pure, earned, innovative in some sense.</p>
<p>Codeparity "Paw" - u ll hear about it....maybe in next 6 months.</p>
<p>Money - is a tricky force - it can switch sides in most weird ways.</p>
<p>Thanks and TC.</p>

<p>if i "knock one out of the park"....which i am known to do "now and then".... it solves for itself ðŸ˜€ </p>
<p>Kind of doing an innovation++ here, a new product, with new "non woke" mannerisms, innovation in baldie teaching.....just too much...</p>
<p>becoming a side note in someone's "win" is really a good future...a joker would have liked a better origin story though....i liked being lazy way too much

<p>"Predictions" seem bang on...if i say so myself. ðŸ˜ƒ </p>
<p>making a lot of money, then doing PR = dressing nicely and all is so much work to me................then dealing with "genius baldies and their sugar-puppas" is kind of v v "unappealing"...and it kind of "becoming the evil, to defeat the evil" cycle.</p>
<p>so you should get why i am making myself more "popular" with each passing day - "improving" even ðŸ˜‚ </p>
<p>naah....i dont think these ppl matter...or ever did - as long as i and we are able to pull our own weight, enjoy met-averse to find it "hilarious"</p>
<p>most of us are psy-oped into a definition of "happiness" planted in our heads....i had to kind of kick it out...and it wasnt so bad.....after a while...</p>
<p>but it is work, a lot of it....and it takes times.</p>
<p>will do bhow bhow 1nce a week....stray engineer has very diff priorites than a pedigree macintosh "hacker"</p>
