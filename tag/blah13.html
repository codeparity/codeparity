<p>They dont look related.</p>
<p>But they are - in some indirect way.</p>
<p>A win - a big $$ MM win - demands 'acceptance' and acknowledgement</p>
<p>A page 3 of win</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a handshake of 'leaders'</p>

<p>The win, like 'happiness' - need to multiply in multiples</p>
<p>Amits and Veronicas - need to 'outshine' the other 'teams'</p>
<p>it is the 'pair' which created 'magic'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the all popular - corp 'team work'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gAwards - just a formality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gAmit' s sigmaness - ensures it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the prime veronica - needs an ack</p>

<p>are a 'needed' ingredient</p>
<p>a perfect - is 'needed'</p>
<p>afterall - the bar is DEI and equal opportunity ü§£ </p>
<p>unkle comics cant defy the 'natural' order..</p>

<p>oh - we will honor this 'rule' of equal 'hotness'</p>

<li>
<p>comics are just a representation of society</p>

<li>
<p>an ideal way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an abridged truth - simplified</p>

</ul>
<p>so the sheep knows - muggary is ultimately finding a sigma and eve - the 1s who are the lords - after all the muggary and 'hard work' of iit/mba etx = the corp god and godesses which bless the 'lesser beings' - by ack a life..</p>
<p>generous peeps. - they are the 'protagonists' - cant ignore that..

<p>demystifying the 'wait'...</p>
<p>i could ve raised 'funding' - any time i wanted...</p>
<p>even before 'resigning'.</p>
<p>I dint like the 'pattern' - the moneybags dictating terms, hearing voices and tribulations of some money baniya - looks immaterial</p>
<p>the reason - the 'investor' is investing - is value..</p>
<p>he sees it...but his perception and use of 'value' is $$</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a drama of sorts...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>timelines, bleh blah</p>

<li>

<p>veronicas which come with money sigmas</p>

<li>
<p>eternal pappus who 'earn' from money sigma..</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that was the real struggle - ...</p>
<p>a perfect - in matrix dimension which matters - to amits and veronicas...</p>
<p>in my neighborhood - the pretti guys - were called chiknaas...</p>
<ul>
<li>fruity peeps, like peeps who cant work real hard work..</li>
</ul>
<p>..their pretty skin - cant stand the sun..</p>
<p>hence this.</p>
<p>never a chikna = not aiming to be 1 too.</p>

<ul>
<li>The SigmaNess benchmark</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a meeting of months in making 10 months </p>
<p>-of veronica's charm and real hard work </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>with many good, pure intention-ed </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>team work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Veronicas' property of hot pink </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>seems to hide the dobbie l6 which she had to tag along </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he was a 0. a burden of sorts - already fired...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>just like an old horse </p>
<ul>
<li>at end of the race tracks...</li>
</ul>
<p>veronica is kind </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>she knew how to ack the old dobbie </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with kindness </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so she tried.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>She worked with team of G </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to get an impossible meeting </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which could ve made her.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For dobbie </p>
<ul>
<li>was already done for.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was the last shot </p>
<ul>
<li>a funeral of sorts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sigma Amit </p>
<ul>
<li>knew all too well.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'account' </p>
<ul>
<li>akin to Tata of Bd.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sigma Amit - knew all the words. all the moves.</p>
<p>With verronica smitten with sigma </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an ask from a veronica - an amit cannnot 'deny'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if it includes humbling the gAshish </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with all his chosen 'heavyweights' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to put him in place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>publically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with a 'win' by 'amit/veronica' and passie</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An epoch of sigmaness - Glevels.</p>
<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<p>The customer could be waay smarter - ?</p>
<p>This is a limited possibility in a gSigmaAmit tesla ms apple superman </p>
<ul>
<li>the supreme murd - gAMIT!!</li>
</ul>
<p>But, things happened.</p>
<p>The 'customer chief' </p>
<ul>
<li>turned out to be real G...</li>
</ul>
<p>in 5 minutes </p>
<ul>
<li>he skinned the passi - in front of veronica..</li>
</ul>
<p>even the mulhotraness of cheap lolipops - dint work..</p>
<p>then - it was dobbie s turn - he was afterall - a senior...</p>
<p>So dobbie talked - sense.</p>
<p>The Customer chief, was not a CIO</p>
<p>a real engineer.</p>
<p>a real citizen working for his peeps - all.</p>
<p>A good call.</p>
<p>Just sigma amit </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in sigmaness kinda sabotaged a XX$MM deal </p>

<p>with an opportunity to do real good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the real room reading ...</p>
<p>he came and picked up a call - from another customer of G..</p>
<p>// a sign - i know what u do, but sigma amit..ignored it</p>
<p>introduced himselves..nicely, precisely..</p>
<p>but sigma amit - tesla bleah, apple bleh...5 mins..</p>
<p>another phone call...hold..</p>
<p>//the same thing - he was being v verbose - indicating he meant business - not $$ bleah blah, which wont be 'viable' in developing world..</p>
<p>his issue - innovation, sustainability - holistic scale up...</p>
<p>no answers...</p>
<p>so veronica tried - like a leader..but she shivered..</p>
<p>another phone call..</p>
<p>and then silence..</p>
<p>then it was upto dobbie - to own the 'failure' - the last cause...</p>
<p>the final backup - the old sdd which fails - is known to fail...</p>
<p>old hdds - have a use..they relate ..there is a reason they still exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>knowing sigmas cant 'lose' - anything - veronica, car, perception...and well...the sigma habits..</p>
<p>i kinda need to ramp up some imaginary cpu cycles - consume babie...lets show what sigmanes++ looks like...</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>

<p>the gpu stuff - arrived ... so sorry for bothering with all this...</p>

<p>Therefore, the art of war lies in: never face a high mountain, never retreat from a down hill, never follow an enemy army faking defeat, never attack an elite enemy army, never bite a shark-bait, never chase after a retreating enemy army, leave opening for a surrounded enemy army, never pressure a desperate enemy army.

<p>‚ÄúSimulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.‚Äù

<blockquote>
<p>i can even debug the 'strategy' and its 'inventors'/contributers...dont ve to be a genius when dealing with hurt dei betti fathers and figures borne and brought up typical kolkatta veronica and then jitendra, kiran...</p>
<p>the hurt betti - must ve learned a lot from the 'l-user' s/he 'won' over</p>
<p>the veronica - not knowing 'worth' - hers, depends on sensei/father figure for 'approval</p>
<p>father figure - trying to hide the absolute smack which blahBlah delieved in his 'naivety' - got 2 for his 'cheetahs' smacked out of ground of G</p>
<p>His/their entire 'sensei-giri' was looki shaky - if blahBlah succeded...</p>
<p>so veronica - followed the plan...</p>
<p>it was so visible...</p>
<p>i dealt with prime veronica - like G prime, not kolkatta prime..</p>
<p>this was just too 'easy'..intense..but easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"humiliation" the prime tool of baldies/veronicas/bettis - i knew this before their dreams of sensei-ness started ...</p>
<p>local arcade...</p>
<p>hence the bleh blah - i can do it without 'fear' - the base on which these subservient 'rituals' are based on..</p>
<p>these 'born genius' never had a chance...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 'veronica' act - involving 'kid' - that was just the 'threshold'...</p>
<p>that really xrossed the 'Lakshman rekha' - my limit...</p>
<p>then that baweja bihari amit jitendra wannabe - were toast.</p>

                <p>Sharing some closing thoughts on nearing the end of 0 journey.</p>
<p>When it started - i was absolutely clueless.</p>
<p>It dint make sense.</p>
<p>All i needed was emi and whatever familia required + 30k personal allowance</p>
<p>It was always there - from my first job.</p>
<p>Dad's hard work - did persist in material form.</p>
<p>In G, things are supposed to be 'secure'.</p>
<p>have to be - thats how people are able to innovate.</p>
<p>else, it is just survival.</p>
<p>I 'assumed'. </p>
<p>People getting paid more than enough, should make them feel 'secure' and do the duty - to every 'brand' they take from.</p>
<p>Corona, made things absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>People, hiding behind screen </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>doing the most 'illogical', yet inhumane things </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with fruity words and straight face.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I never encountered such beings. It was delusional - the peak of human intellect.</p>
<p>Thats like abnormal on psychological level.</p>
<p>Rationality, logic </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>never had a chance with baldies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thats not what their 'hiring' and leadership was based on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was based on 'leverage' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the indian version</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'things' which make people say yes - all kinds</p>
<p>Specially the CIO kinds </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the ones who are supposed to be 'logical' yet are 'stars' of cio magazine </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the creme da creme of peeps who were never engg enough to code</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just fanbois of kamputer engineering klub </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>of income, employment and a chance of escaping a¬†country </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which humbles them by nos of engineers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So i tried - doing what a 'provider' is supposed to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>calculated the 'money vs time' thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how much betti 'needed' vs 'wanted' (she wanted a jeep, few foreign instagram posts, god of ai status - a lot of things. She was born better than me)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the kid - his needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dogs..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what i really wanted to do...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It came out to be a viable sum.</p>
<p>a quantified 'time' to bear baldies and all the familia stuff....</p>
<p>this 0, was quite bloated....computed quite a lot...in time and 'attention' and $$</p>
<p>the 2 years - a debug of 0.</p>
<p>which u now see realized.</p>
<p>the algos - are hard truth.</p>
<p>it happened for a 0 </p>
<ul>
<li>i think this is a 'corner' case - may not happen to anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>But would happen to anyone - if he doesn't 'understand'</p>
<p>Victimness - is the fashion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a veronica/betti logix - i am better - i make the world go around. All peeps - nice to us. So i = better</p>
<p>A surname - is just a validation - a 'boundary' which this matriarchy of society - has been holding them back with...the kid (which they want) - but it should not mean 'leadersheep' kudos..</p>
<p>baldies know this - amits know this.</p>
<p>The father figure - vella of grade 1 with all the 'time' and wisdom...</p>
<p>has incentive - a worshipper in many ways.</p>
<p>a suv, few amits, a title, some recognition - of finally becoming a prom queen in professional life.</p>
<p>The nerd girl prototype and baldie relation..</p>
<p>G enius all around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If any CIO feels offended or 'better", will be putting up 'blah blah hours' to do free consulting.</p>
<p>Free - my kind - it should be fun, if there is no $$. I like humoring CIOs - anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh - i dint apply to G - they sought me out.</p>
<p>It seemed good - money vs time thing</p>
<p>i was never really G desperate - all those startups i lost time on.</p>
