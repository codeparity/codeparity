<p>Engineering  - is a quest to develop logical mind</p>

<p>=&gt; means less time to develop the 'feel' half of the brain</p>

</ul>
<p>a perspective </p>

<p>a conscious awareness of these implied 'qualities' helps 1 counter these DEI cool peeps and their promoters.</p>

<p>a designer can only go verbose within the target audience parameters..</p>
<p>so he hides the secret in symbology - colors, shapes.</p>
<p>Freemasonary - another example of a union of eternal male and female forces ...</p>
<p>taken too literally by their brit masters...</p>
<p>there is another path...actually many paths...</p>
<p>but this '33 degree' 1 - is of compliance and easy guidance...</p>
<p>a spiral of free yet not free - coz its not earned but borrowed?</p>
<p>Therein lies my admiration for Akuma.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the thing about west philosophy - abraxys lucifer baphomet ariman etx...</p>
<p>they tend to prioritize 'other realms/beings' ...ignoring the 3d..</p>
<p>it is kind of insulting to birth itself - if 1 deserves it, 1 would be been born in 3d or some other dimension..</p>
<p>call it random, but ultimately - deal with it...not just 'philosophize' the unknown hockus pockus.</p>
<p>if thoughts create reality - quantum/mass hallucination/consciousness stuff...then isnt all this 'hypothetical' force bleh blah - powering them, making them alive in a dimension which these 'gods' dont belong or need to even refer to.</p>
