<p>basically make 'law' accessible</p>

<p>Nihilism - the lowest layer of existence = the bios instinct</p>
<p>The same thing which powers a baby to find his food and cry when is denied...</p>
<p>has larger consequences</p>
<p>Unless the brain is developed with age++, the same behavior would multiply.</p>
<p>Animals - hyenas, wolves dogs - their fixed nature helps in discovering these hidden common tendency and survival mechanics of 'life'.</p>
<p>Life &amp;&amp; Food</p>
<p>The definition of life -  seems convenient</p>
<p>seems most peeps silently agree that anything which 'shouts' is not worth 'killing'</p>
<p>Killing = shouting or red (blood etc) </p>
<ul>
<li>the sanctimonious line of being 'holy'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence Veganism - the $ construct made to contain and 'divide' people on logic/future</p>
<p>Choices</p>
<ul>
<li>ants, bugs - are life too</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; we dont hear them scream, so eat zee bugs is 'progress'</p>
<p>sure they dont need much to 'grow', have 'protein'</p>
<p>plan to dim the sun, the lizardie pigment lackin 'skin' is progress = all peeps wants to be 'white'.</p>
<p>so we will take do the godlike thing - dim the sun - helps skin, environment</p>
<p>and bugs - they are yummy.</p>
<p>Thats brit ai logic. </p>
<p>the proud toilet paper intellect.</p>
<p>The same ones </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>conquered and defiled every land/concept/culture in not so past distant history </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>now trying to re-define 'food'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Vegetarian - eating zee veggies </p>
<ul>
<li>too 'developing' world for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So lets confuse the english world with 'veganism' </p>
<p>-the cow milk is cruelty, trees are being 'killed', co2 bad - u bad - everyone is a sinner = the guilt trap.</p>
<p>Contradictions:</p>
<p>-Life would happen - some form</p>
<p>-Birth is purposeful</p>
<p>-1 being born a 'human' is part of a purpose.</p>
<p>What 1 eats - is a 'choice' when he has $$, but for most it is not really a choice.</p>
<p>a quest to get the best nutrition - at their $</p>
<p>Ice regions - peeps have to 'hunt' - the 'life' and choice of 'extreme weather'</p>
<p>Veganism - a brit pattern to appropriate a concept.</p>
<p>=&gt; to ridicule it as 'developing'</p>
<p>==&gt; paint it as 'fringe'</p>
<p>===&gt; pervert it to cause 'conflicts'</p>
<p>farms blown up, c02 is suddenly bad after 1971 - the $ standard..</p>
<p>Brit 'knowledge' - is it education?</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the 'climate activists' allegedly torched the nice hotel in which i stayed in.</p>
<p>in 2nd innings - it was the CA summer wildfire. found shelter in a church.</p>
<p>got offered a 'beef sausage' as breakfast..</p>
<p>we had it - it was too gratuitous..felt like a disrespect to the 'god' who sheltered us.</p>
<p>surely the priest offered us the 'way of Christ' - but babie - i choose my religion - dont inherit it.</p>
<p>the sausage was big - i dint like the taste of it - but the intent came from god, in a house of god.
</p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think freedom really means choosing your beliefs and changing them as 1 goes age++</p>
<p>freedom to buy $ things - peeps, fame, stuff - is a bondage.</p>
<ul>
<li>the brit illusion of freedom - buy peeps off their culture, religion, beliefs, ways of living</li>
</ul>
<p>they attack the mind, pervert the feels -&gt; guilt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fish - is an interesting life.</p>
<p>Christianity - treats it a holy food</p>
<p>so do some cultures - Indonesia, Thailand, even ours</p>
<p>"Progress" - eat a fried fish with eyes, mouth intact...</p>
<p>and label peeps who really worship the being as life </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>have the manners to atleast take 'lifelike' parts out of it before consumption - are 'developing'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manners.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the hardcore vegan cool peeps - eat what fells - or whats dying...</p>
