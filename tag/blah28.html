                <p>if u have the unfortunate experience of getting hooked into a 'nerdy/ratty' version of online big boss...</p>
<p>my apologies.</p>
<p>i started writing a series of emails to my son. something he can have access to when he is 18+</p>
<p>The 'loss' of a fatherfigure - akin to base layer of emotional and material experience - exposes u - the 0s.</p>
<p>I had to work through my life - 'reverse engineering' most social constructs after my  loss</p>
<p>in 2003 - the year i dint know if i earned that 'degree' </p>
<ul>
<li>most habitus of engineering/familia - verdict was given </li>
</ul>
<p>0--</p>
<p>this can happen to anyone - a real possibility, considering me, my ways, values and 'bent' limits...</p>
<p>hence the emails.</p>
<p>started writing those emails - became googler after another 0</p>
<ul>
<li>it meant dealing with 'genius' - the time and energy vampires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i realized the truth which every father realized later - the pattern...how out of time all this would sound - the world and its 'truth' - is only relative to religion, $ and 'intents' of masters and alfreds with abduls on standby...</p>
<p>Sounding 'delusional' was a real concern - a typical 'age-gap' thing.</p>
<p>debugging this 'pattern' - makes you really spiral...what should i really 'tell, time, words' - context...</p>
<p>thats how a stray...ventured into history, religion and all...</p>
<p>i dint go into gory details of nepotism - who did what and when - just the 'impact' it had - capitalism, psy/op on society -&gt; habits -&gt; morality -&gt; trends -&gt;  $$++</p>
<p>it is really not that 'genius'.</p>
<p>the debug - critical thinking</p>
<p>=&gt; 'delusional' - if only 1 does it</p>
<p>==&gt; 'failure' - if 1 persists with it üòÇ - its an addiction - tinfoil ppl and all </p>
<p>the patch</p>
<p>=&gt; debug 'intents'</p>
<p>==&gt; critical thinking - life is programmed for it - survival and all</p>
<p>rest - every 0 has 1s which are not brick++</p>
<p>jobs - they are $ balance - your 8 hours of 'low', to have 8 hours of 'life'</p>
<p>everything else - alfred baazi</p>
<p>Hope u learnt - i sure hope my son does, and he is not alone - if 'critical thinking' is really alive.</p>
<p>ppl can just say nay - to neuralink and larger pale lizard brit unkle's pediatric designs</p>
<p>G is an example - i hope this blahBlah - made u learn something.</p>
<p>hack - is the serpant - ppl 'fear' it, for me - another lifeform</p>
<p>respect in parity.</p>

<p>she is not just talking economics - it is the trifecta of power - money, muscle and vision</p>

<p>// though its simple - money++, fame++ -&gt; laid_$++ = approval/success</p>
<p>the 'hack' in this alfred, compliance algo is simple - the exit condition - retirement or 'gyaan gurus' - the universal mentors</p>

<li>
<p>there is no 'value' left, no ideas, just 'experience' of living a day over and over</p>

<p>"Intellectual impotence" - normalized, accepted and celebrated as part of 'success' - 90s 'pioneers' did 'invest' similarly.</p>
<p>'invest' - a grossly misunderstood yet manipulated term. Like everything, it is relative.</p>

<p>It fails for n=0</p>
<p>n=1</p>
<p>yet it scales for N, N+1...to infinity ( or need for control - political, ideological and material )</p>
<p>Political control - what happens now.</p>
<p>Ideological/Religious control - the abstract intent (vector of society)</p>
<p>Material - the enforcement arms - judges, police, leaders.</p>
<p>Who wrote 'ManuSmriti'?</p>
<p>Manu?</p>
<p>Was he all read and able without 0?</p>
<p>how did he break the 'fibonacchi sequence'?</p>
<p>hermaphrodite?</p>
<p>Or just a feminine hating narcissist? </p>
<p>or just like abdul or alfred?</p>
<p>Texts written by man - interpreted by a man, when 'reading' was 'restricted'.</p>
<p>My intent.</p>
<p>My runtime has always been memory/cpu constraints by these java programs - they think memory management doesn't exist, coz lower order $ capitalism programs like me/us/0s - do it for them.</p>
<p>There is much to dissect - but lets enjoy the gFireworks - what happens when java mindset rises and 'wins'.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>manu is just a variable in this iteration of 'matrix'</p>
<p>even abdul/afreds run the same algos - just that the wave of $$ changes - the grand illusion of 'change - blue is bad, red is good' - reps - dems, abdul - alfred, etc...</p>
<p>not so different - just different languages and 'timing'</p>
<p>internet - global connectivity = 21st century - tower of babel</p>
<p>the ppl who run this tower - the boogles, the zamazons, whatever, oil, shinzinpin etc... they know this.</p>
<p>they just want their version of nihilistic 'vision' over yours - sheep of different religions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the leaders, self proclaimed 'mentors'....mine are definitely not without 'self bias', some have appropriated words, intents, ambitions, ideas .... just like an any alfred..</p>
<p>it doesnt work - the religion is complete and independent - its parts dont compute in isolation - so being a hindu and copying this. = doesnt work.</p>
<p>intents = joker here - wont help anyone become $$...</p>
<p>it is gnu - gpl of 'intents'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh there are new 'prophets' or hackers of 'hinduism' ..in order of 'impact'</p>
<p>home minister and progeny</p>
<p>the newly bhagwa businessmen and hindu alfreds</p>
<p>the renaissance 'social media cool peeps' - the rs 500 book writers/ new = Intellect(type HINDU)...</p>
<p>proud ++ </p>
<p>all forgetting the very logical question - if it was so great and all - why did it fall?</p>
<p>then they resort to 'sanatan' coz casteism comes in when 'manusmriti' comes up...</p>
<p>then - the base layer of written text - the vedas</p>
<p>appropriated as 'hindu', now alias 'sanatan' - to get the max vote of sikhism jainism etc...</p>
<p>something 'perfect' works - it is resilient - just like distributed systems eg = earth - the food, the life</p>
<p>sun = time immortal</p>
<ul>
<li>the roots of my 'hindusim' - popular 'Hinduism'</li>
</ul>
<p>so 'CodeParity' = no perceived intellectual inferiority/superiority</p>
<p>it is 10x approach = it works in business - a reboot, no sequels. üòÄ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote some blah about using 'tech' to establish 'parity' - codeparity...</p>
<p>working thorough the 'wheel of emotions' - yours : to tap into 'emotions' - traversing through it - using logic/work.....</p>
<p>i did mention - emotions are result of a 'transaction' - $ is just a symbol - the material part - emotion equation works like maths or %</p>
<p>time -&gt; interest &amp;&amp; 'karma' - the abstract invisible real abstract 'score' ....</p>
<p>the g_baldies[] are learning this ...december is a month of celebration - equinox</p>
<p>though - somewhere the light is dimming....0 sum games..often end like this ... oldies + ego = 'genius egoistical mammoth cockroach jar with king cockroach taking a v v public and 0 fall' - with no 'alternatives'..</p>
<p>should ve been more intelligent...maybe even more years ...like 10,20+ years...</p>
<p>naah - wont have mattered...the higher they r. the louder they fall</p>
