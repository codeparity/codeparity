<p>Masters - they hacked feelings to reboot the matrix....</p>

<p>it was socializing, maintenance, sunbathing, exchange of tools - knowledge </p>
<ul>
<li>everything logical - there was not internet then</li>
</ul>
<p>it created an ecosystem in itself - tools, knowledge, innovation was often done in these 'money minded' yet social indian bunch - the good of capitalism</p>
<p>same can be said about week day/end markets - they are not just bargain spree now - money and food affordability has been been organically maintained due to culture and practicality of it</p>
<p>all that blah - just to underline a basic perspective of luxury vs dependence</p>
<p>a neighborhood where no one knows how to jack a car when its really needed</p>

<p>a an aggregator app which provides few hours of operation, but gives a plastic shiny card?</p>

<p>it is "indian" done wrong - there should be no logical debate about this - govt using ppl and vehicles as cash cows - fines, maintenance, pollution certs yet - no logical sense of it all - other than ppl forced to 'disown' their cars - the paperwork in vintage and all  is all bakwaas when all is needed/wanted is pollution certs.</p>

<p>now</p>
<p>$ magic is fading away - but clawing at last straw</p>
<p>$ internet cant work on genuine money - it was the imaginary $ and dejjires of 'fine life - cannibals' and all - just wanting "diversity" in flavor - empire - control...</p>
<p>where is the "money"??</p>
<p>If Bharat becomes China of Food - good, non expensive 1.</p>
<p>Tech has limits of utility - when the motion and movement is still dependent on a coil and magnet - i dont really think there is much to fear - master are just being funny - angrez version of it 😀 </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>masters need ppl to remain masters - so anything $ would never really become 0 </p>
<p>even by a delusional perspective - they always need and want alfreds, strays - abduls etx....</p>
<p>in my delusional mind...it is a x between 2 strains of entirely different kinds...so there would be no debate about "natural" origins now...</p>
<p>parity - master, alfreds, abduls, strays - would be maintained - no matter what the 'right' one is - the universe seems to be saying so since 2000 known years...but...everyone is right.. 😀 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i literally applied art of motorcycle maintenance to - art of tata nano maintenance...</p>
<p>a car with all the potential in world - yet a 0</p>
<p>...there was a lot of repair, healing to be done...</p>
<p>kind of repeated my own journey - went to $ doctors - workshop etc...only to see the 'official' apathy...</p>
<p>then it kind of became a 0 - even abduls saw it as a cow of cash.. 😀 </p>
<p>it then became symbiotic...car healed me, and i healed her...now we kinda building it all up..</p>
<p>paw.</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gads - they work on 'propensity' to buy - how do you think they calculate that??</p>
<p>psy/op - a very important part of $ subservience - too hard to resist - again the serpent story..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>data - just check the returns by major fmcg companies in last few years...</p>
<p>baba hype went down obviously - it was perverted shariya taxpaying ayurveda hybrid - too weird to last.</p>
