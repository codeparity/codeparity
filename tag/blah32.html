<p>oh, nothing, just few of the things masters have unleashed upon "blahBlah"</p>
<p>good ones, really working hard</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>blahBlah is really a joker</p>
<p>might be "disturbed/delusional"</p>
<p>Summary : His current state can really backfire - considering the "intel".</p>
<p>blahBlah : being an ugly and all -  dint really get ladders - just snakies.</p>
<p>reputation, bad good - is really in actions.</p>
<p>Yeah - it is gonna backfire - I decide when i do it or i need to 'time' it.</p>
<p>In an LGBTQIA+/feelings first world, no real chance, just only more "ridicule"</p>

<p>/*</p>
<p>blahBlah = a former booger employee, brandished - 'non-performer' aka "not as good"/ "Needs Improvement" etc</p>
<p>blahBlah, being very 'improving' - self beating kinds...took it seriously</p>
<p>worked through the self bias, dark night of soul blah and all</p>
<p>it worked.</p>
<p>so blahBlah went to work - logic and execution</p>
<p>this was 2 years back</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>blahBlah was a bully too - in another life, before "duties" took over</p>
<ul>
<li>wolf...of kinds...</li>
</ul>
<p>*/</p>
<p>Now Blah Blah does "Blah Blah" - only pointing out "inconsistencies" in the way of "masters"</p>
<p>well - the master kind of took "an initiative" to brandish blahBlah as "non complaint sheep"</p>
<p>They were right, just that blahBlah wasnt sheep to begin with.</p>
<p>Time - the only thing which eluded blahBlah, due to the circus of "genius ppl" who were "duties" at that time, place.</p>
<p>Time is a wonderful thing. </p>
<p>The very thing which defines "life".</p>
<p>Yet, every pup born or unborn - has his "time" precalculated for him - education, competition - jobs, spouse, cars, sheep++</p>
<p>Time allows you to discern, take a step back .... just to get a perspective of why blahBlah started playing this "circus" without even knowing it....</p>
<p>Science - seems stalled since WW2</p>
<p>Computers - should have "accelerated" innovation</p>
<p>Genome decode - should have atleast cured "headaches" or pimples</p>
<ul>
<li>it just doesnt make sense - inventing ai to replace "us", when "us" is no where near perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>...</p>
<p>all that blahBlah, is just snake talk...</p>
<p>we talk about baldie vengence... it is real.</p>
<p>so baldie hcI 0rackle fame never understood "brand"</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it tells a lot about ppl - being "indian" is a brand too - do they use it, or give it back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a 70 iq genius baldie, way past his expiry date - due to his attitude, is bound to overestimate his "genius" - no sense of "value", just money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so he assimiliated his hcI bretren - to echo the version of "genius" they ran</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it becomes "truth or GValues"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gThanks amongst this new "bretren" of genius -defines a new culture</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is barking at cows at his point - the older ones mooed -while hyenas took over - there was no hope.</p>
<p>the surrender of values.</p>
<p>a lot of words were said.</p>
<p>One kind of triggered blahBlah - 'aukat'</p>
<p>It is a very crude way of asking someone of his "worth".</p>
<p>No matter how much blahBlah hated it, this word has hounded him forever - since long.</p>
<p>There was the real enemy.</p>
<p>Now cut to 2023, the high of baldies is over.</p>
<p>The "brand" pimping done by the erstwhile respectable baldies is being "unpeeled" at various layers - something genius level nepotistic iq baldies never realized</p>
<p>What to do?? Spanking is coming from the alfred above??</p>
<p>Hire a third party.</p>
<p>Find the "hacks" in blahBlah - welcome to try.</p>
<p>Just a 'namaste' to "brand management"</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the joker.</li>

<p>a true testament of the "merit" of the holder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right now - the way things are stacked, it is really a 0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will use this and only this measly sum to take over alfreds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Delusional - I hear you. Quite accustomed to it - it is boring for me now....</p>
<p>My take on nihilism applies to me too - challenges need to rise with "perceived maturity" (https://lnkd.in/dtsiPgfB)</p>
<p>this week may mark the "change" in status - quo - peak of the "$$ magic"</p>
<p>Lets take it to streets now - and make something truly remarkable - something which lays and exemplifies "CodeParity Values" - self maintainable, open source.</p>
<p>Will continue make a joke of 2 - on alfreds and brit masters....our paths will coincide when we start experimenting with "energy stuff"</p>
<p>PS :Looking for collaboration with PCB manufacturers </p>
<p>If you know 1 ( would prefer Indian - money flow/capitalism reasons, please ask them to get in touch with ashish@codeparity.com</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bootstapping - to preserve the ability to do "blah blah"</p>
<p>My mentors "inspired" me to do everything.</p>
<p>Just a combination of those imbibed values - and a test of interpretation of those values</p>
<p>"inspire" is what 1 can ever achieve to do - every one of us needs and aims to - just making the story public to make it fun.</p>
<p>I paid my respects - now making something of that - hoping that someone chooses to not become an "alfred".</p>
<p>Not just cox it is the "right" thing to do - it is also "fun" thing to do.</p>
<p>bullies behind closed doors - they dint see a bully who reformed.</p>
<p>it will be much fun, if it wasnt already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those mitesh, bajwas and other sideys - lets see who holds more "value" after some time.. making this public - the sheer nepotism and base animalistic mannerism  - none of you deserve any "sheen" even in closed circles.</p>
<p>I really learnt from brit masters - the patterns in CS/design - how to "solve"</p>
<p>Though i will solve for me, and something i am really passionate about - u ll see how it solves for the "alfreds" </p>
<p>if it is not evident now, it is going to become v v evident soon ðŸ˜‰ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my selling is a personal "need" $ with INR conversion - imho : best combination which can exist for some time</p>
<p>the next quarters are going to blow, with alternate global currency ex mechanism go online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i like irony - seeding something with snake money to make the snake dance - is poetic and beautiful  !!</p>
<p>a good constraint - to build around.</p>
