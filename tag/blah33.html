                <p>Start with Tech revolution - tesla, spaceX</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Stars are shining, stocks are up - world is singing to your tune</p>
<p>Rejoice, for humanity has birthed its tech "savior"</p>
<p>....this was few years back</p>
<p>then, it became about freedom and claiming it back</p>
<p>....dems/libs are out of control - he says</p>
<p>It is harvest time now, so forget all that</p>
<p>...now attach your biometrics to get a 160 character, "free" voice - so fair!!</p>
<p>summarizing the context:</p>
<p>twitter was about communication - it served a purpose of worldwide "broadcast"</p>
<p>conspiracy ppl call it propoganda - "virality"/"the sob stories", "the proud moments", etc-  ( recommendations blah blah algos which every "big tech" engg crams up, only to never use ðŸ˜Ž ) </p>
<ul>
<li>talk to a real engg, and he will tell you how financially "insane" a M+ fanout global model looks like - it was never financially viable - based on "fanout" alone</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;It served a global purpose of global sync of ppl. </p>
<p>eg farmer agitations in India getting morality lectures from PMs who cancelled bank accounts of their "dissenting" citizens</p>
<p>Now money is not money- but a token.</p>
<p>a token which may allow you to tweet, communicate with "rightly suggested" people (based on location, occupation, pay - sheep stable etc)</p>
<p>X is about global money, it makes sense too</p>
<p>=ai to "generate content", neuralink to "conjure" the content on fly..., tesla to take you around (till its "safe")...and X to do "everything"</p>
<p>WEF likey global money, global society, no religion, no diversity.</p>
<p>-just diversity in the "kind" of people, </p>
<p>NOT</p>
<p>in what they consume.</p>
<p>or read</p>
<p>or believe</p>
<p>or eat</p>
<p>or think</p>
<ul>
<li>just few saviors, who were there in time, to do the right things, when "people" needed them</li>
</ul>
<p>What option do we have - worldcoin seems evil, so go with muskie!!!</p>
<p>A pattern -  like last 100 years of west - create 2 divides, both do the same, but speak in different dialects.</p>
<p>Overplayed? No, i think there is still a lot of "trust" left....</p>

<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Religious ppl have a specific name in the Bible - the deceiver, false light prophet etc...</p>
<p>but we are logic ppl .... we play by "science"</p>
<p>when muskie dresses up as baphomet, as "a joke" .... it is still "science"?? or "cool"</p>
<p>there seem to be a sacred law - they never lie, only deceive/divert</p>
<p>I am just stumped by how accurate some of the depictions are .... and how eroded the faith of a normal human is - in any of the religions - convenient to knit-pick without adhering to the values any of them prescribes.

<p>This is a landmark - i think it would "help" a lot of people in developed countries in "reclaiming" their "lifestyle"</p>
<p>Enterprises like whiterock, asguard etc cant fail because of exactly this reason - they seem like fronts for private citizens/nice masters to "free" the rest</p>
<p>It is a freedom of sorts - to own nothing.</p>
<p>saving or hoarding money is kind of opposite to the wef version of happy freedom</p>
<p>money/assets tied up in this system - is it really "money"???</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This "money" seems more like a timer to exist in the world.</p>
<p>Not issued by Gods, but by tech gods.</p>
<p>AI/IOT/smart farming, smart dogs, smart cars, TVs - they suddenly make sense with this "smart money" ... tech god/masters giving permission to fellow sheep to exist for a time...in a particular way, eating zee bugs, coz earth is bad coz of climate change, sun and aliens etc...</p>
<p>a realistic realization of Wef version of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one considers "time" as an important/schedulable parameter - aliens, viruses, wars, ai, climate change</p>
<p>our masters so considerate and timely in their efforts to "save" us....</p>
<p>btw, unkle billy pediatric MAP gates is a part of this too...</p>
<p>1 should know to explore the rabbit hole by now, else 1 might end up owing/signing to an illusion of "fear"</p>
<p>sheep and wolves etc blah blah</p>
