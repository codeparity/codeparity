<p>they hack 'veronica'</p>
<p>in ways - that is undeniable</p>
<p>yet - not "murd" enough to undo it...</p>
<p>or even try being a "Ram" -bear 3d consequences of it</p>
<p>coz a "Sigma" has money and 'societia' approval </p>
<p>to buy a veronica</p>
<p>and buy perception - to turn veronica -&gt; betti</p>
<p>i have seen this 'cruelity' of endless hacking</p>
<p>in kallege - the most amazing person - an excellent engineer and an even more amazing person - a pure gift...</p>
<p>being robbed - bit by bit...year by year</p>
<p>with the sigma-ness of that 'amit'...</p>
<p>still a 'startup' of an ias father, a fashionably adulating fren/familia</p>
<p>gVeronica - was so tragically predictable</p>
<p>and gAmit and gVeronica...</p>
<p>i dont think they can 'face' each other.</p>
<p>a true loss.</p>
<p>no purpose..or even a chance for it..</p>
<p>hacked by lurv of different dimensions.</p>

<p>the hackiness of amits - they always choose a hack in veronica...</p>
<p>it is really inhumanly hack</p>
<p>in veronica_1 - it was just her right to live college...</p>
<p>and money 'helps' that...frens: convincingly align when they get to do kool stuff together...</p>
<p>same with gVeronica - the human desire to 'belong' to a future point of perfect - the pink life with a prince with modern horse/car plus shining armor of 'security'</p>
<p>it is all very old...v just get blinded by 'glimmer and glam' of it - the spark which draws peeps in.</p>

<p>to some 'baba'....</p>
<p>it was kolkatta approved too 😂 </p>

<p>predict a few hockus pockus 'backfires'</p>

<li>
<p>gAmit is gonna age like anything</p>

<li>
<p>0 of worst kind : peeps knowing his 'aukaat'</p>

<p>a 0 which would last lifetimes</p>

<p>and I - paw...</p>
<p>will reap some 'luck'...</p>
<p>which shows</p>

<p>street pooper </p>
<p>bihar </p>
<p>shehzaada </p>
<p>...fears..</p>
<p>oh...it is gonna unfold in years...</p>
<p>i kinda defeated his 'bapho bakra god'...in my metaverse..</p>
<p>so he is gonna obey...coz this guy...works on divine laws....</p>
<p>as above so below...</p>
<p>and it is going to get real 3d...</p>
<p>with me doing my work...</p>
<p>and few reaping - karma.</p>
<p>bet on it?</p>
<p>i did - 4 years back.</p>
<p>and 100x geniuses did - based on G money.</p>
<p>exciting and expected...yet would unroll slowly with time...</p>
<p>God makes his presence known in very hockusy pockusy ways.. 😉</p>

<p>Wishes - what are they?</p>
<p>Who listens to them? Who do we imagine when we make them?</p>
<p>God, a comet, an eyelash?</p>
<p>or a baba?</p>
<p>i can fairly assume - that intellect which made us : is supremely intelligent.</p>
<p>He/She might ve created few forces - to make a 'soul' experience life...</p>
<p>but then...there are always 'hackers'.. who hack everything - to gain 'something'</p>
<p>Prayers - are no different</p>
<p>Knowing your prayers - is the most ignored aspect of religion/god.</p>
<p>If 1 delegates even that wish to something unknown - I think it would be noticed...and karma would be adjusted.</p>
<p>There is no morality in all this..</p>
<p>i think hockus pockus is like a debt, which just like capitalism and %, needs to be paid back - and 1 needs to make something with this 'debt'</p>
<p>a bet - which 1 makes on himselves - with his will and time/money/faith..</p>
<p>but money peeps, take it as a tool.</p>
<p>thats why...these baldies - are in for 'big results' - in delusional layers of logic. 😀 </p>

<p>i tried reading into 33 degress of masonary bleh blah...</p>
<p>all bs for make them believe - in superiority, justification of their 'know' &gt; soul wishes of others - an entitlement</p>
<p>seems offensive, but hindu.exe is no different 😂 </p>
<p>just 'genius' nepo babies - peddling glory.</p>

<p>gossip = lowest level of 3d wishes/words/spells</p>

<p>familia, sista marriage and frakas - just to "tell' him</p>
<p>quite elaborately, i must say - i dont give up</p>
<p>years of not giving up...</p>
<p>ever since start of career</p>
<p>personal challenges</p>
<p>and being pounced on...by googley poodles...</p>
<p>as soon as i joined when my right hand - barely healed...</p>
<p>coz veronicas - needed dobby...</p>
<p>called him out - explained him humbly, that it wont end 'well'</p>
<p>the sensei - convinienty too busy...</p>
<p>coward had no incentive ...</p>
<p>he thought - he won...</p>
<p>winner now?</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>his au puppa - the skip level - busy in doing christmasy stuff - or playing a hallmark movie 😂 </p>
<p>the genius - had no exceptions - though i think this skip level manager was more scared of 'resistance' of opposing trinity of baldies..</p>
<p>not a leader - in entire tree of hierarchy - lead by karela handsome kerala twin pappu of tech-ugly - the cloud head kerala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this 'move' is called </p>
<p>"lath piche se ---"</p>
<p>a delhi slang...</p>
<p>so tasteful, so colorful - with a lot of meaning</p>
<p>unkles using it- makes it 'interesting'</p>
<p>i call it culture preservation - the essence of being a dilliwala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>its a pattern for me - a chashmish unkle sigma : xrosses mah path...niceness exchanges ....and after much giz bleh...</p>
<p>the surrender..</p>
<p>corona saved the genius... being a former bully of repute...i know the effect of standing over someone's head and looking them in eye - telling them quite coldly : whats gonna happen.</p>
<p>corona : kinda made 'title' v powerful..</p>
<p>heck its over now...unkle is old...he likies mellow rehashes of old classics too</p>

<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i kinda 'know' when to move on...</p>
<p>growth - becomes a logical bet...</p>
<p>in telco huggies - 1st encounter with trinity of 'gods'</p>
<p>1st - wireless</p>
<p>2nd - embedded or he claimed - linux</p>
<p>3rd - execution or bearing managers of no use</p>
<p>this blocked -every possible 'path' - i tried for few years, but then the 'resistance' was of unlaiden hakla nerds of nickelodeon characters of no 'do'</p>
<p>this iteration of baldies : googley 1s - comically no skill - coz most of them : it admins with no solutioning skills : just sell of 'industry' of commodity prods - sap, dbs and bleh blah of our cheeping out competition</p>
<p>hence their 'choice' of picks - they dint ever understood 'startup' : just the self bias of 'brands' being 'bet'</p>
<p>in huggies - its was the ariscent borne</p>
<p>googley cloud - orakle, hc1, tcs, ibm - and other genius progeny of 'breakthough solutions'</p>
