<p>the cockroach jar became bigger, so does the 'repute' in wfh corona peak time...</p>
<p>the 'critical infra' is this info - the nmap like stuff in account plan.</p>

<p>without explanation</p>

<p>it is the real work.</p>
<p>it calms your body down, your brain, your emotions</p>
<p>addictions become a function of trauma, or things 1 really wants.</p>
<p>Painful - yes.</p>
<p>Does it ever ends - 🙂 </p>
<p>No, the perspective of 0 carries over</p>
<p>eg, </p>
<p>imagine yourselves as a very small person - just moving away from city of towers, skyscrapers etc</p>
<p>moving out - cutting yourself out - a zero, helps you identify those towers</p>
<p>you may not see all, but you will see what you are interested in.</p>
<p>Constraints, needs - they really show them when you are at 0.</p>
<p>You will be someone's need.</p>
<p>not want.</p>
<p>and you would have wants - they will become clear.</p>
<p>When you know your 0 - the material freedom - financial freedom - seems quite easy to compute.</p>
<p>see - not all doom and gloom.</p>
<p>Then you come out and do yapping. </p>

<p>the bone healing at 40+ is really a gift from force..specially when i couldnt get it plastered due to 'famialia, great indian police and its - practices'</p>
<p>so gaining strength back in right hand was a literal thing..then i really dint want to become and alfred - just take down the few - used the 'time' - download the masters and all</p>
