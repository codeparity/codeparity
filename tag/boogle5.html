<p>Undetected/Untreated essential mineral deficiencies : </p>
<p>-typical in a 'new money' middle/lower middle class households</p>
<p>-RDA not met</p>
<p>+"Good/Rich" food cooked in very wrong way</p>
<p>eg abduls's biryani : worst food </p>
<p>-depletes zinc</p>
<p>-introduces hormones - oxytocin etc - hormonal cow looking ppl</p>
<p>+burly</p>
<p>-no stamina</p>
<p>-v v less immunity to bio agents</p>
<p>-govt 'genius' planned poisoning - fluoride/chlorine in drinking water, </p>
<p>=&gt; zinc, selenium, essential mineral missing</p>
<p>==&gt; takes away money, mental bandwidth -&gt; irritable, sad, defensive ppl</p>
<p>===&gt; dependent on most useless ppl on planet - $ docs - insurance, etc</p>
<p>====&gt; fast food craving, mental issues of 'buying' online - compulsively</p>
<p>had to debug - kid has high 'propensity' due to unsolvable mystery of 'auto-immune diseases" (vitiligo and later hashimoto's for me)</p>
<p>Debug Result:</p>
<p>Eat less - desk jobs dont really need "protein"</p>
<p>Eat whenever - 1 meal a day really works for labor origin ancestry of mine</p>
<p>Meet your RDA - your workload, kind of job 1 does</p>
<p>1 day a week runner should not be on a 7 day runner's diet</p>
<p>Logic/Belief of all this:</p>
<p>Evolution : 2000 years of 'known' history is in direct contradiction of natures' law -adaptation to change </p>
<p>-Plants do it</p>
<p>-Wolves did it : now stray dogs and all</p>
<p>It started with "Dr Berg" and his logical &amp;&amp; medical 'debug'</p>

<p>"irritability" induced due to hormonal imbalance - is very visible in workplace/public behavior</p>
<p>the g_baldies[] were a cakewalk to 'debug'</p>
<p>-typical '10 minute manger' catchphrases with some 'genius twist' (so it looks orig)</p>
<p>-looks : unkles acting to act cool - 😷 </p>
<p>-no tech/logic : just i am Head of Blah blah; so i am 'right'</p>
<p>-cow kind - visible temper issues</p>
<p>-known industry rep of being a sheep and lurving a sheep</p>
<p>-origins/habitus of '0rakIe/HCI' : confirmed</p>
<p>eg</p>
<p>a newly joined India Head lecturing ppl on 'origins' of a product -anth0s if i remember correctly</p>
<p>for a little read backbentcher like me - this whole greek mythology stuff - is just contradictory to 'accessibility/recall'</p>
<p>but here we have a 50 pushing typical middle class winner educating tenured booglers on 'how anthos did that/that and the thought of naming it - deep' </p>

                <p>Lets take a pause for the silent blue pilled boogler - tasked on "taking me to task" (vengeance of petty baldies is a very real thing - u ll see)</p>
<p>Reputation</p>
<p>Big tech and related/"influence-able" professions </p>
<p>funding</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>boring ....they tried, they keep trying...</p>
<p>The pattern, the weakness, the history...the hack.</p>
<p>A joker is a good one when he is "random"</p>
<p>a brick is trained to think corp version of "outside the box"</p>
<p>sometimes, the solution is <the box>!!</p>
<p>Indians are good at "googleys" - it aint your thing...keep losing those invisible hair 😀 </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for the uninitiated, and still intrigued - the real reason i havent been sued till now...is not a mystery but a real life check-mate of sorts</p>
<p>if they sue me, i being a 0, get "noticed"</p>
<p>i have the docs</p>
<p>the docs lead to a slew of "intelligent" ppl, in sarkari banks, in global mnc, etc - who have normalized selling info as their "value" in the "market"</p>
<ul>
<li>similar to bank scammer/callers who hold your info, keep a tab on your financial run ins/issues and are helpful to sweep in your time of needs </li>
</ul>
<p>same thing, just that instead of phone numbers, the incompetence of these ppl is captured on those documents</p>
<p>i was supposed to be a scrape goat - to feed the punjabi/pakistani - superior race / intelligent worthy ppl</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>not done, actually...now i get started. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in computational terms - distributed systems scale well</p>
<p>consensus, in a human society is a product of mass awareness- consciousness </p>
<p>the psy hack of "feelings" which validate "a version of success" is "unsaid mass consensus"</p>
<p>$$ is absolutely useless to me...but it serves a purpose, a hack</p>
<p>a hack which validates a conflicting idea...suddenly becomes "likeable"</p>
<p>i would share my "gestalt" ...but it needs to be earned...else it would be as useless as blah blah done on this baldies and alfreds - who are an "example" in this live exercise of "merit" or "idea"</p>
<ul>
<li>i make it interesting to keep it engaging for me...it is a pattern for me now, they just dont know how many "invisible" baldies lie in my path...already..just an observation</li>
</ul>
<p>narcissist/delusional....lets judge after 4+ years....</p>
<p>judgement is best used on rich, powerful, alfreds and masters...but its a cockroach world, aint it?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>anything....but 1 thing is for sure, truth resonates more with $$ and as you "googlers" know - i have a mouth and skills to back it up...</p>
<p>should be "excited"!! a brave new world!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gaming?</p>
<p>free/sustainable energy?</p>
<p>gyan guru?</p>
<p>independent director?</p>
<p>???
