<p>"leaders", googlers and "role-models" - for weak willed, unskilled, greedy - future newbie alfreds.</p>
<p>The essential part of last 18 months was - i did not want to deal with these ppl </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>degrades my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fighting with pigs in mud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for money, fame - 2 of the most limiting things when u want to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a general assault on physical senses of sight, hearing and 'logic'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;lose time and energy - genius level tail wagging comps.</p>
<p>the "brand" is mud now. Google will be going downhill from now on - eu/brics ...u ll see.</p>
<p>I ll do my part - the mail has all the names, verbal lying recordings and a lot of "other stuff" </p>
<ul>
<li>so lets be done with "genius booglers" - light that fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not new - the out of warranty oldies and their ego massaging alfreds have crossed my path, only to find out the significance of "Tanwar" 🙂 </p>
<p>The game could have been over the day i resorted to lowest layers of existence - nihilism - i came from it. </p>
<p>Subtle things which you realize when u have outplayed it - the game is as good as the opponent - a defeat is a win if the opponent has skills which you admire - helps you imbibe them.</p>
<p>A game with fake leaders and their psychological/virtual/real offsprings has no win for me.</p>
<p>I took time to debug myself - last 20 years changed something in my psych, the silence which was there when i needed it, was not there.</p>
<p>I couldn't enjoy coding - my initial "feeling" when i chose CS as career.</p>
<p>The answer was much deeper and it took time.</p>
<p>Money perverted my motivations in ways that it was too subtle to debug.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to pinpoint the reason - the tools, the ide, the os, or the hardware or me.</p>
<p>It took some time, and now we are back. </p>
<p>Lets play our own game now, shall we?</p>
<p>A win has a proud feeling to it - it feels pure, earned, innovative in some sense.</p>
<p>Codeparity "Paw" - u ll hear about it....maybe in next 6 months.</p>
<p>Money - is a tricky force - it can switch sides in most weird ways.</p>
<p>Thanks and TC.</p>

<p>if i "knock one out of the park"....which i am known to do "now and then".... it solves for itself 😀 </p>
<p>Kind of doing an innovation++ here, a new product, with new "non woke" mannerisms, innovation in baldie teaching.....just too much...</p>
<p>becoming a side note in someone's "win" is really a good future...a joker would have liked a better origin story though....i liked being lazy way too much

<p>A future cannot be created in isolation - i am very well aware of it.</p>
<p>For that, i will form a team of strays - will invest in them in all ways to make "wolves" out of them - brave and stupid enough to really protect their family, community and hence country</p>
<p>A distributed system scales well - there are patterns hidden in reptoid tech - for their thought process - they see us as programs, psyoped into "execution" or dependence by force if necessary.</p>
<p>A future cannot also be created in explaining the "merit" to competing habitus companions</p>
<p>respect changes its value when existence is at lowest level - nihilism</p>
<p>Our haarp =&gt; manipur, punjab, rajastan, west bengal are indicators of Indias' participation in this.</p>
<p>WHO setting HQ in Guj</p>
<p>Bollywood??</p>
<p>Minority appeasement</p>
<p>No real reforms - police, judicial - netas/parties would only create extremes and milk the most sensitive one - global fact</p>
<p>no one is coming to save you or me - there is no neo, we need to trust our skills - or really if you like metaverse and kids at state's disposal - no judgment - tc and be happy in Neom</p>
<p>for those father/mothers - who have suffered and see the "suffering" with no respite in sight - logically or practically - intellectual judges and genius politicians - our HM is the best ever!!</p>
<p>A simple geo location based analysis at telecom providers' end would provide all the "genius" clues and the network of all "nice ppl"</p>
<p>but it wont be ever done - the system works for people who create and protect it</p>
<p>it is not that bad - it is badly hack-able - you just have to really look at it again - disern</p>
<p>Money, freedom, privacy - all for the ones who really deserve it, and are willing to really work though self bias.</p>
<p>So really, wake up.</p>

<p>true diversity is accepting people for who they are, correcting them if they are at imbalance with nature, respect.</p>
<p>wef/alfreds version of convoluting "diversity" with "globalization" via tech, fear and global supply chain is really a focused attempt at destroying local cultures and lifestyle.</p>
<p>ppl scratched head when flipfart was valued at B$$, even i did.</p>
<p>a $ backed by nothing is just a tool to gather intel on us, kids, habits.</p>
<p>Walmart, amazon are debt/investment based enterprises with alleged Minor Attracted Persons on board...maybe</p>
<p>Whiterock/Asguard adhere to ESG, something imagined by English masters. Alfreds hide their presence.</p>
<p>Best companies of the world gobble us best talent on fake $, make them fat, lazy, rich and general "gifts to society"</p>
<p>all they do is make money, get consumed in it, cox baby no one tells them about real truth of existence = a balance with env, a realistic version of their own happiness, not the boogle/instagram/pathan version of it</p>
<p>it is not really about being popular</p>
<p>the truth is in stats - 1 % will lead</p>
<p>if those 1% are rational, the 99% will follow</p>

<p>Yeah LinkedIn, your peers at boogle couldnt stop me when they literally had my leash for 2 whole years - stuck in the throat while i "joker" my way out of every lure - different forms of feminine(money, fame, women etc)  or the more subtle/boogley ones - take time off, take mental therpy/reprogramming lessons from a "genius" on payroll</p>
<p>they have a whole file, suggest you get it c/via them - it had some NFT signatures as well, so please honor them 🙏 </p>
