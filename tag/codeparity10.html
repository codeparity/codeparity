<p>now,</p>
<p>future</p>
<p>and history, science at all - only to establish or unestablish a path - whether it works, or is just a fantasy - history and all - known, observable 1</p>
<p>too abstract - i get it...</p>
<p>it goes like this...</p>
<p>now - if $$ is the issue (it would be - $ is the unsaid religion)</p>
<p>really consider the credit and debit - how they have changed over years - as you got income/age++</p>
<p>the best 0 to compute is bachelor days - the brief period - if any ...when 1 had more $$ than to spend</p>
<p>thats you 'good' 0</p>
<p>then now - the cars, the properties, the emis, or returns - their time value and variance...</p>
<p>the difficult part - the feelings which these 'debts' or assumed 'investments' cause you - things - easy</p>
<p>ppl - v v difficult...</p>
<p>time is the real $$, the money $$ is an illusion - which makes your 0++ - habitus and their 'emotional' expectations</p>
<p>=&gt; your time and its value = the lowest time returns  - yet dependents </p>
<p>some duties, most just emotional debts - the proverbial cockroach jar - which keeps moving in rhythm with "trends" - cool cars, homes, tech - to establish </p>
<p>$$ superiority in order of alfreds.</p>
<p>thats how 1 really knows - what he wants - get skilled++ = ai, tools, tech - all free, all available for anyone..</p>
<p>but then, the real hack is 'looking good', make it till u fake it and all - suckers work, smart ppl earn - the hidden msg in all the stevie jovs, mukerzerx and now - muskie and faultman...</p>
<p>cant fix a tyre - yet 'kings' of their ponds of glory - the title and all..always afraid of not being the psy/op the superman title does to ego - for spouse, kid - etc...not worth it -imho </p>
<p>your 0 - is different from mine</p>
<p>my wants are as unique as my origin story - hence my actions.</p>
<p>a 0 - is knowing this for sure.</p>
<p>$$ money is a tool - can be 'hacked'/borrowed - if u get 'good'</p>
<p>metaverse is really needed for some ppl - wont do well in real 1 😂 </p>

<p>the reason i say $ is the real religion...is simply that most religions require some clothes, some things - festivals and all to really abide and receive blessings - the psy/op of being an eternal sinner/always owed gratitude and all - morality of it</p>
<p>religion of codeparity doesnt require anything - a 0 - just the true cost and money of life - time</p>
<p>the most you know u - the more conscious 1 can be in spending his $$</p>
<p>we live in a world where 'geniuses' are millionaires - skill / passion and all</p>
<p>different programs should produce different outputs to same habitus</p>
<p>but bricks - they are same ... they have to be...the are needed to build empires.</p>

<p>The delhi i grew up had a weird culture - every sunday, every unkle would take out his car, scooter etc - to give it a weekly routine</p>
<p>it was socializing, maintenance, sunbathing, exchange of tools - knowledge </p>
<ul>
<li>everything logical - there was not internet then</li>
</ul>
<p>it created an ecosystem in itself - tools, knowledge, innovation was often done in these 'money minded' yet social indian bunch - the good of capitalism</p>
<p>same can be said about week day/end markets - they are not just bargain spree now - money and food affordability has been been organically maintained due to culture and practicality of it</p>
<p>all that blah - just to underline a basic perspective of luxury vs dependence</p>
<p>a neighborhood where no one knows how to jack a car when its really needed</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>a an aggregator app which provides few hours of operation, but gives a plastic shiny card?</p>
<ul>
<li>the base principal - own what you buy.</li>
</ul>
<p>hackability of it - means relevance of it - means long term usability of it.</p>

<p>One of the weird yet illogical things done in India - $ capitalism is to put 10/15 years on 'longevity' of their cars</p>
<p>who would maintain their vehicles - they have a depreciating $$ attached to it</p>
<p>it is "indian" done wrong - there should be no logical debate about this - govt using ppl and vehicles as cash cows - fines, maintenance, pollution certs yet - no logical sense of it all - other than ppl forced to 'disown' their cars - the paperwork in vintage and all  is all bakwaas when all is needed/wanted is pollution certs.</p>

<p>this just making "distributed systems" cities - which are organic - they existed before $$ went out of gold standard..</p>

<p>Mp3 players were not new - they lacked a WalkMen.</p>
<p>Someone saw what music really does - opens up people.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge of frequency manipulation - using music as a tool to stir up common emotions</p>
<p>war, religion, sorrow - sometimes well deserved, sometimes "hacked" or forced</p>
<p>It all rhymes - when you know what news is going to parrot on, and what the musical 'hack' would be.</p>
<p>napster, iphone - all can be viewed as tests and commercial deployments of these hacks</p>
<p>bitcoin, cdbc</p>
<p>freedom, controlled freedom</p>

<li>a pattern </li>

<p>baphomet pattern</p>
<p>cia did invest to 'hack' audio - to hack brain - it sounds very 'harry potter' but then, it seems to work - search yt on solfeggio and cia 'astral travel' experiments - munroe institute and all</p>
<p>the scary part - if, and if this is science and true - in 1970s...</p>
<p>then, can there be any capitalistic deployment of such 'invisible' hacks?</p>
<p>🤔 </p>
<p>anyways - hacked a g_baldie_1 sauce seems palpatable ...</p>
<p>the hack works if you know how 'good' you are...</p>

                <p>The "Key"</p>
<p>To debug yourself:</p>
<p>Understand and quantify the "emotion"</p>
<p>eg - right now </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why this guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does he ever work...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the emotion - curiosity, hate, lurv etc</p>
<p>and i am all those things 😀 </p>
<ul>
<li>but lets make it about "debugging"</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did 1 feels that - the reason and logic is the key</p>
<p>the thought process goes like this</p>
<p>hate</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i hate his face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate cox a 0 cannot be "right" - brand always is "company, religion, leader etc"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate the "disrespectful-ness"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to sum it up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pause, take a breath</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask the "why"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>see - no going to a "quiet" place or "being holy" and all -effienet and hacky as you would like it - engages - the Neo brain (conscious thinking) over impulse.</p>
<p>As an engineer - understanding "why" - to the level of perception i have - was satisfying.</p>
<p>The logic "whys" - the layers to which 1 can debug himselves - the bigger Neo he becomes (Neo-cortex) something which evolves vs the very physical, literal lizard brain we all have.....</p>
<p>//he is delusional , still why i am i reading this??</p>
<p>// ask the "why"</p>

<p>the tone - authoritative</p>

<p>...no different than evolution or devolution.</p>

<p>It is only going to get increasingly evident - how valuable software engineering as a sole skill is.</p>
<p>I wrote about it some time back - https://lnkd.in/deSBx4ej</p>
<p>The real intent of this post is to share a public mark - for the stray brotherhood</p>
<p>Sold the measly alphabet stock </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>it is not much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>money is an approximation of value, value which is in the hand of the holder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a true testament of the "merit" of the holder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>right now - the way things are stacked, it is really a 0</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will use this and only this measly sum to take over alfreds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Delusional - I hear you. Quite accustomed to it - it is boring for me now....</p>
<p>My take on nihilism applies to me too - challenges need to rise with "perceived maturity" (https://lnkd.in/dtsiPgfB)</p>
<p>this week may mark the "change" in status - quo - peak of the "$$ magic"</p>
<p>Lets take it to streets now - and make something truly remarkable - something which lays and exemplifies "CodeParity Values" - self maintainable, open source.</p>
<p>Will continue make a joke of 2 - on alfreds and brit masters....our paths will coincide when we start experimenting with "energy stuff"</p>
<p>PS :Looking for collaboration with PCB manufacturers </p>
<p>If you know 1 ( would prefer Indian - money flow/capitalism reasons, please ask them to get in touch with ashish@codeparity.com</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bootstapping - to preserve the ability to do "blah blah"</p>
<p>My mentors "inspired" me to do everything.</p>
<p>Just a combination of those imbibed values - and a test of interpretation of those values</p>
<p>"inspire" is what 1 can ever achieve to do - every one of us needs and aims to - just making the story public to make it fun.</p>
<p>I paid my respects - now making something of that - hoping that someone chooses to not become an "alfred".</p>
<p>Not just cox it is the "right" thing to do - it is also "fun" thing to do.</p>
<p>bullies behind closed doors - they dint see a bully who reformed.</p>
<p>it will be much fun, if it wasnt already.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those mitesh, bajwas and other sideys - lets see who holds more "value" after some time.. making this public - the sheer nepotism and base animalistic mannerism  - none of you deserve any "sheen" even in closed circles.</p>
<p>I really learnt from brit masters - the patterns in CS/design - how to "solve"</p>
<p>Though i will solve for me, and something i am really passionate about - u ll see how it solves for the "alfreds" </p>
<p>if it is not evident now, it is going to become v v evident soon 😉 </p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my selling is a personal "need" $ with INR conversion - imho : best combination which can exist for some time</p>
<p>the next quarters are going to blow, with alternate global currency ex mechanism go online.</p>

<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i like irony - seeding something with snake money to make the snake dance - is poetic and beautiful  !!</p>
<p>a good constraint - to build around.</p>
