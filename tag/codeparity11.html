<p>A future cannot be created in isolation - i am very well aware of it.</p>
<p>For that, i will form a team of strays - will invest in them in all ways to make "wolves" out of them - brave and stupid enough to really protect their family, community and hence country</p>
<p>A distributed system scales well - there are patterns hidden in reptoid tech - for their thought process - they see us as programs, psyoped into "execution" or dependence by force if necessary.</p>
<p>A future cannot also be created in explaining the "merit" to competing habitus companions</p>
<p>respect changes its value when existence is at lowest level - nihilism</p>
<p>Our haarp =&gt; manipur, punjab, rajastan, west bengal are indicators of Indias' participation in this.</p>
<p>WHO setting HQ in Guj</p>
<p>Bollywood??</p>
<p>Minority appeasement</p>
<p>No real reforms - police, judicial - netas/parties would only create extremes and milk the most sensitive one - global fact</p>
<p>no one is coming to save you or me - there is no neo, we need to trust our skills - or really if you like metaverse and kids at state's disposal - no judgment - tc and be happy in Neom</p>
<p>for those father/mothers - who have suffered and see the "suffering" with no respite in sight - logically or practically - intellectual judges and genius politicians - our HM is the best ever!!</p>
<p>A simple geo location based analysis at telecom providers' end would provide all the "genius" clues and the network of all "nice ppl"</p>
<p>but it wont be ever done - the system works for people who create and protect it</p>
<p>it is not that bad - it is badly hack-able - you just have to really look at it again - disern</p>
<p>Money, freedom, privacy - all for the ones who really deserve it, and are willing to really work though self bias.</p>
<p>So really, wake up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>true diversity is accepting people for who they are, correcting them if they are at imbalance with nature, respect.</p>
<p>wef/alfreds version of convoluting "diversity" with "globalization" via tech, fear and global supply chain is really a focused attempt at destroying local cultures and lifestyle.</p>
<p>ppl scratched head when flipfart was valued at B$$, even i did.</p>
<p>a $ backed by nothing is just a tool to gather intel on us, kids, habits.</p>
<p>Walmart, amazon are debt/investment based enterprises with alleged Minor Attracted Persons on board...maybe</p>
<p>Whiterock/Asguard adhere to ESG, something imagined by English masters. Alfreds hide their presence.</p>
<p>Best companies of the world gobble us best talent on fake $, make them fat, lazy, rich and general "gifts to society"</p>
<p>all they do is make money, get consumed in it, cox baby no one tells them about real truth of existence = a balance with env, a realistic version of their own happiness, not the boogle/instagram/pathan version of it</p>
<p>it is not really about being popular</p>
<p>the truth is in stats - 1 % will lead</p>
<p>if those 1% are rational, the 99% will follow</p>
<p>eg the "agree?" like sheep, the tedx speakers etc 😀 </p>

<p>Interestingly, Dido predicted the failure of matrix - the source of irritation of our leaders - the irrational behavior towards kids - the love which they confuse us with in "interstellar"</p>
