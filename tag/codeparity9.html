                <p>Mathematical induction and Religion</p>
<p>Every religion has a central figure - a God alias : the deemed 'God'</p>
<p>If i give example of any other 'religion' - blasphemy risks - abdul or alfred might get triggered..</p>
<p>so i ll use mine - Hinduism and its nepotistic 'tool' - perceived deemed 'God' - Manu</p>
<p>Manu = 1</p>
<p>where is 0?</p>
<p>We need 0s - mathematically/logically or even materially. Where is 'egg'???</p>
<p>It fails for n=0</p>
<p>n=1</p>
<p>yet it scales for N, N+1...to infinity ( or need for control - political, ideological and material )</p>
<p>Political control - what happens now.</p>
<p>Ideological/Religious control - the abstract intent (vector of society)</p>
<p>Material - the enforcement arms - judges, police, leaders.</p>
<p>Who wrote 'ManuSmriti'?</p>
<p>Manu?</p>
<p>Was he all read and able without 0?</p>
<p>how did he break the 'fibonacchi sequence'?</p>
<p>hermaphrodite?</p>
<p>Or just a feminine hating narcissist? </p>
<p>or just like abdul or alfred?</p>
<p>Texts written by man - interpreted by a man, when 'reading' was 'restricted'.</p>
<p>My intent.</p>
<p>My runtime has always been memory/cpu constraints by these java programs - they think memory management doesn't exist, coz lower order $ capitalism programs like me/us/0s - do it for them.</p>
<p>There is much to dissect - but lets enjoy the gFireworks - what happens when java mindset rises and 'wins'.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>manu is just a variable in this iteration of 'matrix'</p>
<p>even abdul/afreds run the same algos - just that the wave of $$ changes - the grand illusion of 'change - blue is bad, red is good' - reps - dems, abdul - alfred, etc...</p>
<p>not so different - just different languages and 'timing'</p>
<p>internet - global connectivity = 21st century - tower of babel</p>
<p>the ppl who run this tower - the boogles, the zamazons, whatever, oil, shinzinpin etc... they know this.</p>
<p>they just want their version of nihilistic 'vision' over yours - sheep of different religions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the leaders, self proclaimed 'mentors'....mine are definitely not without 'self bias', some have appropriated words, intents, ambitions, ideas .... just like an any alfred..</p>
<p>it doesnt work - the religion is complete and independent - its parts dont compute in isolation - so being a hindu and copying this. = doesnt work.</p>
<p>intents = joker here - wont help anyone become $$...</p>
<p>it is gnu - gpl of 'intents'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh there are new 'prophets' or hackers of 'hinduism' ..in order of 'impact'</p>
<p>home minister and progeny</p>
<p>the newly bhagwa businessmen and hindu alfreds</p>
<p>the renaissance 'social media cool peeps' - the rs 500 book writers/ new = Intellect(type HINDU)...</p>
<p>proud ++ </p>
<p>all forgetting the very logical question - if it was so great and all - why did it fall?</p>
<p>then they resort to 'sanatan' coz casteism comes in when 'manusmriti' comes up...</p>
<p>then - the base layer of written text - the vedas</p>
<p>appropriated as 'hindu', now alias 'sanatan' - to get the max vote of sikhism jainism etc...</p>
<p>something 'perfect' works - it is resilient - just like distributed systems eg = earth - the food, the life</p>
<p>sun = time immortal</p>
<ul>
<li>the roots of my 'hindusim' - popular 'Hinduism'</li>
</ul>
<p>so 'CodeParity' = no perceived intellectual inferiority/superiority</p>
<p>it is 10x approach = it works in business - a reboot, no sequels. 😀 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote some blah about using 'tech' to establish 'parity' - codeparity...</p>
<p>working thorough the 'wheel of emotions' - yours : to tap into 'emotions' - traversing through it - using logic/work.....</p>
<p>i did mention - emotions are result of a 'transaction' - $ is just a symbol - the material part - emotion equation works like maths or %</p>
<p>time -&gt; interest &amp;&amp; 'karma' - the abstract invisible real abstract 'score' ....</p>
<p>the g_baldies[] are learning this ...december is a month of celebration - equinox</p>
<p>though - somewhere the light is dimming....0 sum games..often end like this ... oldies + ego = 'genius egoistical mammoth cockroach jar with king cockroach taking a v v public and 0 fall' - with no 'alternatives'..</p>
<p>should ve been more intelligent...maybe even more years ...like 10,20+ years...</p>
<p>naah - wont have mattered...the higher they r. the louder they fall</p>

<p>Why 'music' is very important </p>
<ul>
<li>central pillar of 'feelings'  - the trigger which makes $ capitalism - buy!</li>
</ul>
<p>cia/dhs etc </p>
<ul>
<li>the enforcement arm of masters - are the pioneers in the idea...</li>

<p>religion of codeparity understands this 'input' and its hacks...</p>
<p>music can be a powerful tool to jump emotional states or explore more answers ...</p>
<p>...both halfs of brain</p>
<p>human brain = logic + feels</p>
<ul>
<li>balance - one ness.</li>
</ul>
<p>ai is just logic.</p>
<p>can mimic emotion - its just voice modulation and servo moters to produce 'expressions' - a path of execution taken off from specific inputs - no different from any other output.</p>

<p>they 'assume' something...i dont assume anything....hacking at this 'level' requires walking few fine lines - undetectable by 70 iq genius.</p>
<p>The "impact" has been due for some decades </p>

<p>Chester Bennington/ Linkin Park is a rabbit hole in itself....</p>
<p>the 'feelings' in those compositions is 'raw, unadulterated'</p>

<p>ideas - pretotyped, prototyped and validated.</p>
<p>searching for most fertile ground for paw...not a problem .... just finding 'optimal' one</p>
<p>in the background g_baldies[] or g_baldie_1 thought it would be better if they have some backing from 'blahblahs' habitus - techPappus techCheetas bosses, mentors and all</p>
<p>that was a 'bait'</p>
<p>and g_baldies[] took it....</p>
<p>the habitus debug - that took a lot....</p>
<p>but now, the gurus and 'mentors' are known - in autkaat, in worth, in intellect, capabilities...</p>
<p>in this all - a lot of digital evidence...physical evidence...</p>
<p>the finer part of region of codeparity </p>
<ul>
<li>pick fights to learn and elevate.</li>
</ul>
<p>there was no elevation here, just arguing and fighting for some imaginary 'status' or 'clout' as called now -a -days 😂 </p>
<p>its over.</p>
<p>I dont care.</p>
<p>else - explicit taunts - arcade style!!</p>
<p>...clearly - it is risk reward for me - $$ perspective when 'feelings' go away...</p>
<p>just $$ now - it seems to work for 'critical mass' - material sufficiency.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
