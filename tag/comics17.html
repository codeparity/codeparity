<p>I always liked Raj comics' Druv, over "shape-shifting/icha-dhari"...</p>
<p>though it seemed to be more 'popular'....</p>
<p>and snakes, their characters - are known, even mysterious...</p>
<p>so Veronica class has a hidden power/method, which gets unlocked with gVeronica++ or just Veronica++</p>
<p>In 3d metaverse, it is a lethal move composed of:</p>
<p>emotions</p>
<p>dei</p>
<p>feelings</p>
<p>and - empowerement..</p>
<p>no wonder they are the most femme fatale - the sacred devi of Unkle comics - confused, yet powerful beyond measure...</p>
<p>gAmits makes the gVeronica++</p>
<p>and Kiran - at top of it all - the fame, the desire, the sigma, the dei model!!</p>
<p>Some hidden characters - would soon be known - gTwists are 'unimaginable'!!</p>

                <p>Kiran Bajwa - an origin story</p>
<p>Kiran was born in a wealthy family.</p>
<p>Ignored, not really blessed with conventional beauty, Kiran had a penchant for 'games'.</p>
<p>Fame and Game - the 2 strengths of Kiran.</p>
<p>Knowing full aware of his strengths and weaknesses, Kiran tried hard in life to get everything with makes her notice to the larger, conventionally good looking ppl - a lot of insecurity of growing up in a good family with all means.</p>
<p>Kiran is a warrior - she just know what she deserves and what stands in her way.</p>
<p>In 20s, Kiran went all in - nihilistic way.</p>
<p>Flattery, Greed - 2 of the biggest hacks Kiran identified in his 'journey' of fame, glam and 'page 3 success'</p>
<p>Computers/Tech seemed to be most quickfire way to achieve this - prove it to the larger habitus of ppl - the spouse and kids - all amazed at Kiran succeeding with these 2 hacks - lust of different kinds.</p>
<p>Decades went on, Kiran perfected the tools out of 'fear'  - used his bulging stomach and hunger with western suits and language, to his advantage.</p>
<p>She realized the age and its 'projection. </p>
<p>Young-ins looked up to her - his ways were interpreted as ways of a Sensei - the one who knows how to get the job done.</p>
<p>She realized and created a following of loyal followers - his all professional experience boils down to following algo</p>
<p>How do i look - (to others) : Perception</p>
<p>How to build it : add more gurls and guys </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the nerdy cheerleaders of IT sector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make an example of the guy who stands out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use the cheerleaders to weed out the opposition - no harm, no fowl - they did it all within themselves</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;&gt; sensei lesson within cheeleaders, the ones who take the lead and accomplish the 'task' </p>
<ul>
<li>Kiran's chosen ones - the passi</li>
</ul>
<p>Great algo.</p>
<p>worked for all pros - 1bm, hc1, 0rak1e etc - decades went and the hard taskmaster 'sensei kiran' became popular.</p>
<p>All was working - but Kiran wanted more..</p>
<p>Kiran was successful - just not the kind she imagined.</p>
<p>Kiran loved 'Mike''s role in GodFather </p>
<ul>
<li>a movie she barely understood, yet liked.</li>
</ul>
<p>This limited understanding of life - movies, professional/personal life - was working out for him - The force seems to be with her with the 'ambition' of appearing on a page 3 still unachieved.</p>
<p>This domestic/natural adulation - did not seem to matter to kiran - she wanted a life, a legend - everything like Babar of Ghazanvi</p>
<ul>
<li>cont.</li>
</ul>

<p>Missed an important detail - despite being in tech, kiran kept her faith in a sort of 'god' - the underworld - called hockus pockus, or occult in her native household - she doesnt know anything, yet tried everything, assumes some 'spiritual knowledge'</p>
<p>....she dealth with baphomet - her allegiance and needs - all align with solve et coagula. - lust and losss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we will put in plugs for the 'horror' genre - just provides a bigger metaverse </p>

<li>though kiran keeps it klassy - tarot and weird mantras and all - easy money - easy targets.</li>
