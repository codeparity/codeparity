<p>...apparently the mass mail wasnt enough ü§£ </p>
<p>"you are just too nice...dont change....!!"</p>
<p>"i wish to meet you someday...."</p>
<p>"will help out...call me if you need me"...</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>a lot of sentimental bleh blah...</p>
<p>finally the golden question...</p>
<p>"btw, what was your CTC ?"</p>
<p>...more questions in till last detail...the % of take home etx.</p>
<p>gAshish ... if he could "change", then this wont be happening üòÇ </p>
<p>anyways....gAshish had plans ...lots of them..</p>
<p>so turning off that gLappy was the 1st act of 'freedom' after years..</p>
<p>it felt good..</p>
<p>finally....some time...!!</p>
<p>there was lots happening...</p>
<p>gVeronica expected gAshish to 'fold' - grovel and come in after some 'negotiation'</p>
<p>i never turned the laptop on - it had ghouls...of $</p>
<p>then gVeronica calls again...probes what is expected 'closure'...</p>
<p>i made some figure up...</p>
<p>gVeronica - acting all gLeader - " thats too much"</p>
<p>discussed "accounts" as if they mattered anymore...</p>
<p>i dont think gPeeps ever got an engineer who had more disdain for G than likey for $</p>
<p>...and gVeronica : obviously queen of her 'realm of pretty'...</p>
<p>the deception was long drawn...too trashy, too predictable</p>
<p>gAshish did expect some 'apology' from her...</p>
<p>but egos - wrote lots of bleah blah on that...</p>
<p>i simply never thought that parents' death, physical injury etx </p>
<ul>
<li>the whole lot of 'things' would make gPeeps behave like 'humans'</li>
</ul>
<p>wrongo - hyenas dont change character...</p>
<p>// </p>
<p>wanted to close this last gVeronica thing..</p>
<p>the 'class' aukaat etx - was just too legenday..</p>
<p>gAshish really hoped for a "better" honeytrap üòç </p>

                <p>Feeling guilty : Unkle_comics</p>
<p>This is a weird time in unkle comics. Guilt seems to be the primary emotion.</p>
<p>gAmit : Guilty of making promises and delivering a lot of them</p>
<p>gVeronica : Accepting an offer of lifetime lurv - togetherness : good things.</p>
<p>It is quite intense when weekend fun strats planning good times, turn into a lot of 'doubts'.</p>
<p>gAmit : convinced in his mind that gVeronica is going to leave him </p>
<ul>
<li>sooner or later. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ego and mind </p>
<ul>
<li>doing everything in its power to hold on to the happiness that is gVeronica in his life.</li>
</ul>
<p>gVeronica : is different now. </p>
<p>She seeks different. </p>
<p>Alkuhul doesnt seem kool anymore. </p>
<p>Parties seem to tire her. </p>
<p>Her priorities are different.</p>
<p>No one knows - trends/relationships/fashion...they all change.</p>
<p>gAmit and gVeronica talk, but lot is unsaid.</p>
<p>The gPhone password is known to gAmit, yet the phone seems his biggest enemy.</p>
<p>Whenever gVeronica takes it away, demons appear in his mind </p>
<ul>
<li>separation, sigmaness, loneliness: </li>
</ul>
<p>fear.</p>
<p>gVeronica senses it...she tries her best to assure him.</p>
<p>yet doubts remain.</p>
<p>it is like an unspoken word </p>
<ul>
<li>a name which can be spoken, but should not be.</li>
</ul>
<p>gAmit is nostalgic of trips and all the vows which they made to each other....families and future.</p>
<p>subtly reminding her of the 'words' she said and what they mean - religion is holy.</p>
<p>Yet, it seems 'words'. </p>
<p>Eyes - giving away the fear...</p>
<p>That is why, gAmit and gVeronica are made for each other.</p>
<p>They both lurved..</p>
<p>maybe kind of lied to themselves of the reasons..</p>
<p>maybe gAmit planned this lurv</p>
<p>...based on how it would look - money society etx</p>
<p>and gVeronica did the same .</p>
<p>..it looked good.. and it is...it was.</p>
<p>Maybe this is it. a happy ever after.</p>
<p>but doesnt feel like it... </p>
<p>does it?</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>Unkle comics seem to be resonating with few individuals - such sorry state is highly regretted : gAshish feels guilty too üôÇ</p>

<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Logically - gAmit being 10 years older, veteran, leader, sigma, rich and all - who kinda 'strategized' this lurv : should not be giving any guilt gyaan</p>
<p>but vows/promises : are not logical.</p>
<p>gVeronica : made a lot of vows too. She ll keep this - family and money : are too real for already rich peeeps.</p>
<p>rich and pretty peeps vows/promises have a physical property - societal equivalence.</p>
<p>Vows are meant to be made and honored with equals - money/looks etx.</p>
<p>i think they taint a soul. Forgetting them seems easier, and every1 tries but they are like xombies too - they keep coming back</p>
<p>Some vows are tainted from start -Lurv 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cost of lurv : in 3d money is quantifiable</p>
<p>every weekend needs to be 'something' : finding calm needs to be advertised, togetherness : parties, smiles and all.</p>
<p>cars, dresses, perfumes, trips, investments etx</p>
<p>too bad when the salary money seems 'uncertain' ...</p>
<p>the taj mahal of corporate convenience and perception : rarely last long ...</p>
<p>betting against all odds here - for lurv!! ü§£ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gAmit doesnt want to look like a luser in 50s</p>
<p>the repute : is priceless</p>
<p>master of psy op : the long list of Veronicas...</p>
<p>"but this 1 was the prime" - he keeps telling them...the 'needyness' is stinky</p>
<p>the pain...the helplessness..</p>
<p>time...years of it...only makes it difficult.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the comics are boring and frankly - mindnumbingly predictable for me..</p>
<p>sure - a lot of feelies may likey it, live it, find excuses ...</p>
<p>but thats past - 4 years</p>
<p>i dont live there.</p>
