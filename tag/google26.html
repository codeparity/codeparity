<p>this is latest - after banning a world renowned doctor, it is an "Indian" which is at the receiving end of youtube's morality policing.</p>
<p>Context : an Indi video creator - called "String"'s content was banned and taken down.</p>
<p>String creates content to bring out true/factual history of India</p>
<p>(minus pathans and their time travel inventions, and british master's manifestation of toilet paper)</p>
<p>Anything which builds confidence of Indian native population is extremely problematic to Indian alfreds who milk the "indian" label to beg for those jobs.</p>
<p>Pichai/Kerala boot polish cloud - i wrote to all about the theft of "hacker paradise" - "detailed account plans" - ip addresses, phone of personnel, os, versions, lan org, nat, firewall vendors</p>

<p>"leaders", googlers and "role-models" - for weak willed, unskilled, greedy - future newbie alfreds.</p>
<p>The essential part of last 18 months was - i did not want to deal with these ppl </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>degrades my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fighting with pigs in mud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for money, fame - 2 of the most limiting things when u want to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a general assault on physical senses of sight, hearing and 'logic'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;lose time and energy - genius level tail wagging comps.</p>
<p>the "brand" is mud now. Google will be going downhill from now on - eu/brics ...u ll see.</p>
<p>I ll do my part - the mail has all the names, verbal lying recordings and a lot of "other stuff" </p>
<ul>
<li>so lets be done with "genius booglers" - light that fire.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not new - the out of warranty oldies and their ego massaging alfreds have crossed my path, only to find out the significance of "Tanwar" ðŸ™‚ </p>
<p>The game could have been over the day i resorted to lowest layers of existence - nihilism - i came from it. </p>
<p>Subtle things which you realize when u have outplayed it - the game is as good as the opponent - a defeat is a win if the opponent has skills which you admire - helps you imbibe them.</p>
<p>A game with fake leaders and their psychological/virtual/real offsprings has no win for me.</p>
<p>I took time to debug myself - last 20 years changed something in my psych, the silence which was there when i needed it, was not there.</p>
<p>I couldn't enjoy coding - my initial "feeling" when i chose CS as career.</p>
<p>The answer was much deeper and it took time.</p>
<p>Money perverted my motivations in ways that it was too subtle to debug.</p>
<p>It becomes difficult to pinpoint the reason - the tools, the ide, the os, or the hardware or me.</p>
<p>It took some time, and now we are back. </p>
<p>Lets play our own game now, shall we?</p>
<p>A win has a proud feeling to it - it feels pure, earned, innovative in some sense.</p>
<p>Codeparity "Paw" - u ll hear about it....maybe in next 6 months.</p>
<p>Money - is a tricky force - it can switch sides in most weird ways.</p>
<p>Thanks and TC.</p>

<p>Kind of doing an innovation++ here, a new product, with new "non woke" mannerisms, innovation in baldie teaching.....just too much...</p>

<p>Precision</p>
<p>-bardie clearly is designed for ambiguity</p>
<p>-alfreds have succeeded in making computers - imprecise</p>
<p>that is quite a 100x, moonshot, x kinda achievement!!</p>
<p>Efficiency</p>
<p>TPS - Tokens per seconds seems to be the defining characteristic of "practicality" of any ai model</p>
<p>bardie seems to be happy spouting off boilerplate, master pleasing stuff - clearly running more cycles than required </p>
<p>(GPUs are known to help in sustainability - atleast "knowledge/search/ai" would say so)</p>
<p>Relationship</p>
<p>it seems like a very public one. Bard is the personal errands alfred.</p>
<p>Seems like an "objective" - bard/google establish "truth" by pushing ad/free "news" as "service" to their "users"</p>
<p>a mass product - a common sync between the rich and normal sheep.</p>
<p>Rich ones can afford Siri anyways.</p>
<p>Alexa runs the house...</p>
<p>They put so much thought into it.. all pseudo psych characters required by an isolated individual =&gt; divided society, provided by capitalistic bots with equal or competing share of a users psych.</p>
<p>That is quite an example of "do no evil".</p>

<p>PNB should be informed by now - how its information is being "stolen"/"traded" by Big Tech - like google, oracle - despite GOI's guidelines about tech usage in Banking and Fin.</p>
<p>When reported, it seemed like a private matter between who "american" entities, with no respect to the quality and the confidentiality of information shared - including psych profile of key personnel/ip adresses.</p>
<p>Lets start a random counter on 1 Sept 2023 - for all people involved to inform CERT/GOI/PNB to avert a possible compromise on Indian Banks. </p>
<p>If it happens anyways, i would have to come forward with what i know and have.</p>
<p>I was/am contractually obligated to observe silence - NDA</p>
<p>Now i am obligated as my duties as an Indian.</p>
<p>Lets start this "random" counter - when this "expires" in my head = a mail draft would be sent - to all parties concerned - with confidential PNB infra documents which i have no reason to have or access to </p>
