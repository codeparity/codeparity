                <p>I hope the 'religion' thing is making sense now..</p>
<p>hindu-ism as a religion is not defined, and wont be ever defined due to 'beneficiaries' attached - historical, now and future</p>
<p>that kinda leaves it open to attack - its diversions, its various profound implications..</p>
<p>these last few gens - are product of insta , snap and whatever debauchary bolly /holly and other english speak complaint peeps allow...</p>
<p>cool/moral - dont care / dont know : hence animal and 50 shades of grey</p>
<p>news - always divisive, intelligently worded and 'served' by soros tech</p>
<p>and you just cant blame them - thats their life - happiness, career etx</p>
<ul>
<li>being cool being popular, rich and all those things in less time</li>
</ul>
<p>you have a consumer generation which wants to comply to go global</p>
<p>why would they listen to a sanatani unkool looking guy who 'restricts' their global ambitions?</p>
<p>saffron camp - is an echo chamber...</p>
<p>hence a need to redefine religion - as it would be interpreted by 9 year old</p>
<p>coz really - this gen has been 'fed good food' - physically which makes adhd feels normal</p>
<p>and mentally - what is popular is truth...</p>
<p>and they make it a mission to make their belief the truth - thats just entitlement and overall sigmaness of each 'adult'.</p>

<li>fighting for 'survival' - this is last stand for them</li>

<p>70 years of 'system' 'intellect' 'history' 'guilt' - corroborated by education, 'discovery of india' + 90s baldies + trad businesses who cant fight 'change'</p>
<p>vs few 'already branded and perceived safforn peeps' - all liked and retweeted / shared amongst similar peeps </p>
<ul>
<li>an echo chamber</li>
</ul>
<p>vs a global 'narrative' of 'victimness'.</p>
<p>the saffron strategy had too less 'heroes' and many fighting for life...</p>
<p>UP results... are a stark reality of 'beliefs' and how unshakeable they are - once food becomes an entitlement and surity.</p>

<p>thats just googley principles applied to target audience..</p>
<p>you 'tailor' the content to make it 'easier' for the 'user' to click...</p>

<p>this is about 'subtle education' - the musicals and the feelies of bolly holly overriding 'knowledge - ancient'  -coz cool 'now' is done by bollywood and 'cool peeps'..</p>

<p>u have to understand the koolness of getting your first mark citizen  - the election goo which is a 'target' for this new kool peeps - it would be 'posted' and likeyed 🤣 </p>

<p>the 'truth' being ncrt and 'newspaper' - toi/etx.</p>
<p>the same global/brit brand - soros : define kool/likeable on insta..</p>
<p>so their truth is validated and re-tweeted as they know it..</p>
<p>and hence the disconnect with 'messaging' or sanatani peeps.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think baldies end up 'projecting' their own 'truths' on their hyena clans...</p>
<p>gAmit - asking Kiran to step in...to 'advise' gveronica - how 'lucky' she is - to have 'met' gAmit...so many peeps want 'salvation' via 'partying' with him... 🤣 </p>
<p>logic - never really agreed with kiran or migtest..</p>
<p>few years in 'jail' - are a real possibility...</p>
<p>considering all the lying...</p>
<p>corp bribes...</p>
<p>then all the 'token money' for frens - to run 'trials'..</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>just too much to come back from...</p>
<p>but kiran - is a sensei for a reason...the mastery of kissing boots/rings ...and playing abla naari by mitesh agrawal ...</p>
<p>are the real 'masterful performance' in this family drama of cloud selling innovation.</p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that 'pretty' thing - was a real googley for gAshish...</p>
<p>i dint know gVeronica felt that way... 😍 </p>
<p>obsession - had roots of 'curiosity'...that became 'forbidden fruit'...</p>
<p>it is quite sad...but thats life and choices.</p>
<p>gVeronica - following his father figure middle klass life.</p>
