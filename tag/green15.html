<p>logic of all of this</p>
<p>I ve seen "good" people choosing silence/inaction due to repercussions of speaking out - money, in many forms</p>
<p>The reason i shared my origins - for most of my life, i was made to believe that what my grandad did - was not necessary and evil</p>
<p>Ppl were divided - no one dared asked my Grandad, but judgements were made</p>
<p>Those judgements influenced a lot of ppl - me too</p>
<p>I chose way of my father - education - whatever drew my interest</p>
<p>I saw a division of an idea of "Hindu/Indian" - which had extreme bearing on me</p>
<p>We are reliving the same choice - all of us</p>
<p>Option - this wont and cant happen</p>
<p>I have seen stories, things which i was told to be not proud of...but then, education and morales - they dont seem to apply to green ppl - just the taxpayers - the ppl who slog it out to provide for..</p>
<p>yet, just a sheep </p>
<ul>
<li>money and its value is too apparent to - ppl in kashmir, now israel and some alive ancestors in Delhi too </li>
</ul>
<p>Our former PM (Pv Narasimha Rao) made a very beautiful statement - not making a decision is also making a decision</p>
<p>conversely - not speaking out is also a decision.</p>
<p>silence only emboldens the bully - a former bully knows.</p>

<p>I tend to go "bitey" - stray and all...and i have a "paw" too...ðŸ¤”</p>

<p>The .01% rich "white ones" know.</p>
<p>They dont really care about religion, just their place in the world - considering "oil" may go bbye - it anyways was - sun, renewable etc.</p>
<p>this all, is obviously a delusional scenario</p>
<p>What would a "culture" about to be "irrelevant" do?</p>
<p>Come at full force, afterall, they "might" be a trigger force for a larger truth - the upper layer - money.</p>

<p>it is not a 'joke'</p>
<p>i was borne and brought up in "chirag dilli" - the name might give an indication of 'the history/lineage' of the place</p>
<p>the 'news'/'videos' coming out of Israel - are still 'moderate'</p>
<p>My grandad - became 'sarpanch/leader' of the village - because he knew 'how to handle' the green ones.</p>
<p>he was good at it - unanimously elected the 'leader' till his last days</p>
<p>My father knew the change in 'times' =&gt; post 1960s</p>
<p>Grandad's "bravery" - had real economic/social costs - education and compliance was the way to go</p>
<p>I was confused - i did not know what to believe in.</p>
<p>Israel is my confirmation - it is logical, coz the book hasnt changed or the madarssa.</p>
<p>Police, law - are retrospective measures - it wont be wise to depend on them</p>
<p>Prep is better than cure.</p>
<p>Lighter, cheap deo = awesome portable flamethrower.</p>
<p>Keep dogs.</p>
<p>Stay vigilant.</p>

<p>the cloud game - full of out of date baldies - who sold "boxes"</p>
<p>suddenly they are needed at "cloud leadership"</p>
<p>none of these guys can really explain cloud to a newbie engineer - they never used it - only preach it.</p>
<p>the pnb thing - hiring of the orakle leadership - was due to their in-prem deployment. GOI forbade cloud in banking long ago - still "detailed account plans" are needed by baldie alfred</p>
<p>i dont think even he knew- he was busy chasing his "golden" bone out of country which treated his as per his "aukaat"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cloud is a "apps" thing - roi/risk is manageable</p>
<p>the "enterprise" part - someone running those servers at superior bandwith, with less cost (discounts etc)</p>
<p>sometimes the discounts wont even justify the "electric cost"</p>
<p>but, they are offered = "strategically"</p>

<p>I dint learn it on purpose - i was on "receiving" end of it.</p>
<p>Always trying to "reverse engineer" - I dint react as i was expected to....initially i did, but you learn</p>
<p>it becomes increasingly evident - the internal "broadcast messaging" - they things, portfolios, the kind of companies/assets they are after....telecom/banking are the "highest" priority, then the nihilistic layers - water, land, agri, electric - whatever the host govt would "allow" them to do</p>
<p>colorado usa - they destroyed a whole city, a river with countless animals to set up the "cloud farms"</p>
<p>yet, the 'news' is their 'fren' so you ll never hear it</p>
<p>just how "big tech" cares - planted trees, green campus and glory...</p>
