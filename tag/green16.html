<p>it is the iphone story all over again - people craving for society approval and endorsing a company which makes "no bones" about creating a "closed ecosystem"</p>
<p>the closed ecosystem leads to 15 minute cities - at mercy of ppl who make "no bones" about their "intents" - and hey, i absolutely believe in their book - history is totally spot on - you got to admire the simplicity of algorithm.</p>
<p>so the green ppl create fear, the messiahs solve for fear - using tech</p>

                <p>Rx - a symbol mostly popular for use in medical prescriptions has as lot more going for it</p>
<p>-It may mean a controlled or prescribed burn (RX) in context of "fires"</p>
<p>-In "genetics", it is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RAX gene.The RAX gene is located on chromosome 18 in humans, mice, and rats.</p>
<p>there seems to be an awkward relevance to these "less known" interpretations to this symbol</p>
<p>The wikipedia entry seems "suggestive"</p>
<p>".</p>
<p>Controlled burns on Australian savannas can result in an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring "strategic fire management across 28,000 square kilometres (11,000Â sqÂ mi) of Western Arnhem Land" to partially offset greenhouse gas emissions from a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin, Australia.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dgbs7sq9</p>
<p>the other one - 'genetics' related .... is being pushed in our lives by "prescriptions" and "subscriptions" - viruses, flues, vax etc</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dfMHYiTH</p>
<p>symbols seem important - they do have a story to tell, and it may turn out to be an important story to know.</p>

<p>Symbols seem like an "exchange" of sorts</p>
<p>people invest in it, masses trust it - it makes money flow in a practical/capitalistic world</p>
<p>the choice of symbols is curious - reptoid symbols stand out - medical, $ money, doctor etc</p>
<p>it is a purest "investment" in a capitalistic world - the word of snake - the demiurge of the world - recognizing and pledging your allegiance - soul and material</p>
<p>it delivers too...but it doesnt "evolve"</p>
<p>evolution can be different from what we perceive. The vedas dint write themselves, and the "dark ages" might really be the "light ages"</p>
<p>The pyramids, the left over temples in south - are impossible to build even today</p>
<p>dark ages?? ðŸ˜€

<p>The X in new twatter is curious, isnt it?</p>
<p>the makhichoos paid so much money for it.....a "brand" was destroyed...</p>
<p>it must mean something significant, important.</p>
<p>There is some incentive for people to force these symbols on us.</p>
<p>it is costly, ugly and defies capitalism</p>
<p>still, it flew</p>
<p>Inversion of symbols is a common concept. Swastika still being inverted and appropriated by west as 'Hakenkreuz' is the most prominent example of a religion/tribe being psychologically brainwashed into not using it</p>
<p>it inverted form - 'Hakenkreuz' still is defined as "swastika" in all white/master/genius ppl literature</p>
<p>who cares about correcting them ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X - It seems like an inverted cross to me, but why should i care....the people who "invest" in this symbol in its non inverted form seem to forget what it represents...a union of horizontal and the vertical</p>
<p>a sort of balance between what can be characterized as feminine/adaptability/humility - the horizontal and the strength of a vertical structure - typically classified as masculine</p>
<p>=&gt; now being reduced as a union of none - a single entity which is all consuming, all powerful</p>
<p>there is not much to symbols, it is intuitive if you "constellate" correctly - as the unknown prophet says and guides</p>
