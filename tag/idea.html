                <p>The 'spark' of an idea - a startup, an org, family - anything</p>
<p>the 'spark' is abstract...a thing, an approach - mostly a plan</p>
<p>which leads to some 'intent' being realized.</p>
<p>i dont want to make it fruity, but a spark is like a kid..</p>
<p>a kid which needs to be taught rules and life, progression and how it would age</p>
<p>It needs a family, which is 'true'</p>
<p>coz the 'intents' of this pseudo family, define the 'spark'</p>
<p>provide 'nutrition' and 'challenges'</p>
<p>to evolve with 'time' - age well</p>
<p>trust - in a family is the true ingridient</p>
<p>if trust is not there, the focus is not on kid, but on trust</p>
<p>the who did it, or why did it happen, or not happen</p>
<p>...the arguments - consume time</p>
<p>deplete trust</p>
<p>and hence no 'flow' or 'focus'</p>
<p>often the 'spark', this abstract kid, ends up being 'pimped' out</p>
<p>it is the culture - of success</p>
<p>money, being the win, fame and accolades of page 3 : stamp it 'nice'</p>
<p>be-coming early : the baldie phenomena of 90s genius</p>
<p>is a virus</p>
<p>it tells the entire ancestory - of the 'spark' : what was the 'price'</p>
<p>or the 'win' quantified as 'pimps' value it.</p>
<p>hence the life of spark...</p>
<p>a family after family, with different intents</p>
<p>and different be-coming early levels</p>
<p>capitalism at its finest : when money is the biggest religion, then inventions</p>
<p>can be buried with money and fame</p>
<p>patents : who never made it to mainstream production : nano tech, graphene etx</p>
<p>explicit examples of 'spark' being pimped out.</p>
<p>the money runs out : investments, cars , perception</p>
<p>...but like a parent, the spark is missed and regretted.</p>
<p>...ask the veronicas of the world...they 'win'.</p>

<p>i am saying 'veronicas' here, rather than amit...the init of this 'pimping' - is always with veronicas..</p>
<p>the kid needs a motherly figure...the 1 which is asked and equipped by nature : with feels and initial nutrition...it is the motherly instinct...assumed by law and socitia.</p>

                <p>Hyenas</p>
<p>Spotted hyenas gather in social groups bigger than any other carnivore — their packs can number up to 130 individuals and they’ve been observed defending territories of up to 620 square miles. They live by the clan, and everything they do is tied up with the female dominance hierarchy that underpins it, but they don’t remain together all the time. Instead, they spend much of their time in smaller splinter groups that coalesce in order to fight, hunt or feed.</p>
<p>Grey Wolves :</p>
<p>Wolves are opportunists. They test their prey, sensing any weakness or vulnerability through visual cues and even through hearing and scent. Contrary to ambush predators that rely on the element of surprise and a short and intense burst of energy to secure their prey, wolves are endurance or coursing predators. They chase their prey, often over longer distances, sometimes even a few miles, in order to find the right animal or opportunity. On the hunt, wolves work together with certain individuals typically carrying out their specific role in the hunt, often based on age, gender and social standing.</p>
<p>Anyone can 'win'?</p>
<p>gawd, this all is so accurate .... and still so visible</p>
<p>the articles : are a good read..</p>
<p>it may resonate with a lot of our peeps and packs</p>

<p>Learnt even 'nature' at google cloud. Baldies are good 'leaders'...and results - are incoming. </p>

                <p>Self destruction or ignorance of destruction</p>
<p>self destruction is letting destruction happen.</p>
<p>..it may be voluntary or involuntary...</p>
<p>but self is destroyed.</p>
<p>eg voluntary self destruction </p>
<ul>
<li>donation blood, money, time organ</li>
</ul>
<p>or loss </p>
<ul>
<li>accidents, money loss, or physical loss </li>
</ul>
<p>but i am about the not observed...</p>
<p>time</p>
<p>time is created and destroyed</p>
<p>which in turn leads to a change in matrix/maya.</p>
<p>cell change, intents change, money balance changes </p>
<ul>
<li>% is driven by time...</li>
</ul>
<p>and so does a need/want </p>
<ul>
<li>to change.</li>
</ul>
<p>while this is all 'material' in most aspect...</p>
<p>some % of its change </p>
<ul>
<li>destroys something from conscious to the unconscious</li>
</ul>
<p>possibilities or hope : change</p>
<p>years have the most noticeable impact </p>
<ul>
<li>decades seem like a slap in face.</li>
</ul>
<p>but then, it is always about the feels.</p>
<p>..why did this snapshot of nostalgia - makes 1 feel that way...</p>
<p>something destroyed, something created.</p>
<p>u ll remember the frames...i ideal 1s...and the delta...of today..</p>
<p>the good 1s - the wins : the delta of 'achievements'</p>
<p>those - are the dimensions of 'matrix/maya' which matters to 0s.</p>
<p>some self discovery - coz we all see our matrix with our gestalt and habitus.</p>

<p>toxic relationships - best example of voluntary - yet ignored self destruction...</p>
<p>the relatable example - drama peeps : something is always 'happening' - kools : adventure, dinners, birthdays - breakups/marriages/engagement , and my fav : oh : i found the 1 (again++) 😂 </p>
<p>there is no 1 : unless you know your 1s and 0s - else its just 'ignored voluntary self destruction" - coz time is lost, purpose gets farther and hopes diminishes.</p>
