                <p>if u have the unfortunate experience of getting hooked into a 'nerdy/ratty' version of online big boss...</p>
<p>my apologies.</p>
<p>i started writing a series of emails to my son. something he can have access to when he is 18+</p>
<p>The 'loss' of a fatherfigure - akin to base layer of emotional and material experience - exposes u - the 0s.</p>
<p>I had to work through my life - 'reverse engineering' most social constructs after my  loss</p>
<p>in 2003 - the year i dint know if i earned that 'degree' </p>
<ul>
<li>most habitus of engineering/familia - verdict was given </li>
</ul>
<p>0--</p>
<p>this can happen to anyone - a real possibility, considering me, my ways, values and 'bent' limits...</p>
<p>hence the emails.</p>
<p>started writing those emails - became googler after another 0</p>
<ul>
<li>it meant dealing with 'genius' - the time and energy vampires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i realized the truth which every father realized later - the pattern...how out of time all this would sound - the world and its 'truth' - is only relative to religion, $ and 'intents' of masters and alfreds with abduls on standby...</p>
<p>Sounding 'delusional' was a real concern - a typical 'age-gap' thing.</p>
<p>debugging this 'pattern' - makes you really spiral...what should i really 'tell, time, words' - context...</p>
<p>thats how a stray...ventured into history, religion and all...</p>
<p>i dint go into gory details of nepotism - who did what and when - just the 'impact' it had - capitalism, psy/op on society -&gt; habits -&gt; morality -&gt; trends -&gt;  $$++</p>
<p>it is really not that 'genius'.</p>
<p>the debug - critical thinking</p>
<p>=&gt; 'delusional' - if only 1 does it</p>
<p>==&gt; 'failure' - if 1 persists with it 😂 - its an addiction - tinfoil ppl and all </p>
<p>the patch</p>
<p>=&gt; debug 'intents'</p>
<p>==&gt; critical thinking - life is programmed for it - survival and all</p>
<p>rest - every 0 has 1s which are not brick++</p>
<p>jobs - they are $ balance - your 8 hours of 'low', to have 8 hours of 'life'</p>
<p>everything else - alfred baazi</p>
<p>Hope u learnt - i sure hope my son does, and he is not alone - if 'critical thinking' is really alive.</p>
<p>ppl can just say nay - to neuralink and larger pale lizard brit unkle's pediatric designs</p>
<p>G is an example - i hope this blahBlah - made u learn something.</p>
<p>hack - is the serpant - ppl 'fear' it, for me - another lifeform</p>
<p>respect in parity.</p>

<p>she is not just talking economics - it is the trifecta of power - money, muscle and vision</p>
<p>lets ignore the grand 'intents' of g_baldies or baldies in general </p>
<p>// though its simple - money++, fame++ -&gt; laid_$++ = approval/success</p>
<p>the 'hack' in this alfred, compliance algo is simple - the exit condition - retirement or 'gyaan gurus' - the universal mentors</p>
<p>In reality,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>there is no 'value' left, no ideas, just 'experience' of living a day over and over</p>

<li>
<p>value in $$ : inflation, perception and assets - all relative to next alfred++</p>

<p>now i have more $$ than i can consume, what todo with $$++?</p>

<p>investing is really the downfall for an alfred - money shows what ppl really are</p>
<p>-cars</p>
<p>-houses</p>
<p>-gadgets</p>
<p>-vacations/affairs</p>
<p>-cool stuff - material/emotional</p>
<p>how does this 'black swan' connect to 'blahBlah"?</p>
<p>"Intellectual impotence" - normalized, accepted and celebrated as part of 'success' - 90s 'pioneers' did 'invest' similarly.</p>
<p>'invest' - a grossly misunderstood yet manipulated term. Like everything, it is relative.</p>
<p>this 90s mass 'intelligence' has 'scaled'.</p>
<p>to me, a stray wolfie - it simply means karma </p>
<ul>
<li>of all 90s grads wagging their tails to western toilet paper - it made them feel 'clean'</li>

<p>imho, baldies, inc me  and their 'success/invaluable contribution' to whatever is not going to make much sense to next gens - tiktokies and instas - too cool to notice, too proud to admit - it is all there on 'youtube/ fav influencer' etc.</p>
<p>all part of "future"</p>
<p>.. who needs few out of rhyme/trends baldies who dont even know who pogan laul is - his cool drinks, unkle billy's rescue efforts, climate change, vax, need to darken the sun - elders are all part of it...they approve.</p>

<p>What i am story-telling here - is a v v 'nice' abstraction of the 'niceness' of baldies.</p>
<p>g_baldies[] were/are not the first baldies to cross my path, steal ip/ideas, eating salary etc...</p>
<p>One of the most deceptive desi lizard is literally named after Street Fighter baddie - Bison</p>
<p>In real life - S Bison....</p>
<p>the 'entrepreneur' 'visionary' - who literally destroyed and continue to mislead all newbie telecom engineers - with perception - for decades now.</p>
<p>The reason i am using this perceived 'low blow' tactic - of online de-masking is for something which i perceive greater good - next gen should do better than this nobody, nevebeen, glorified broker.</p>
<p>Oh - he is going to get real sued for real code stealing - it was just me prioritizing human targets to hack - in a very delhi-joker way.</p>
<p>In Codeparity - we call it 'debug' - knowing the 'problem'</p>
<p>The reason, which elevated this nobody, neverbeen, hasbeen, wannabe 5 foot of glory - hakla english, nepotistic traits - to my focus is simple - karma is due.</p>
<p>so bisen - i r next, dont do the baldie trick of 'age forgivenes' - a hindu would have retired or apologized or just do 'chully bhar paani....'</p>
<p>The larger reason - concept of forgiveness - what it really means, and how society - erswhile nobody baldies - denying retirement for blue_pills++, hot_hr++, car++ while(){ cout&lt;&lt;"Oh economy is bad";} </p>
<p>scales - balance with % - we "digital telesoftware engineers" - one of the best bunch of hungry engineers - all brokered by few 'baldies, telecom geniuses' - to the real slavery we were sold off to a lala of great repute - including PF - left lalu behind.</p>
<p>M bison is taller, doesnt have napoleon complex - he is a villain, but a good one.</p>

<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this 'genius' went out of way to publish my 'salary' to future employees - costing me the telecom cockroach jar....</p>
<p>now i see the jar and king cockroaches...</p>
<p>good i left that regressing habitus - it has it gods - unfallable - time immaterial, local afreds -&gt; gods of tech</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the g_baldies or baldies in general - rule by a 'perception' - i call them telco gangs</p>
<p>hss, ariscent etc - all 'leadership' geniuses - progress is counted as how to 'extract' more data for money - the learn from G</p>
<p>the old baldies, now g_baldies[] - they share this habitus - of rub my back, ill rub urs - the saddest page 3 imho - real baldies with 'treatments' - posing for the ever in making - telco startup success $$</p>
<p>dint happen for any of them - 20 years + 😂  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>u meet lots of self perceived logic gods in desi telecom circle - one was on - oh gluten is bad - went on rants on how rice is good</p>
<p>selective logic - apni halat dekho, phir gyaan do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>glassdor etc - broker 'reviews' - any entrepreneur knows that...</p>
<p>high time next gen starts calling out 'decades old gods' - they are viscious in this jar, just nice in 'office;</p>
