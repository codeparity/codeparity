                <p>Delusions, beliefs and perception = truth</p>
<p>this is a personal discovery - walking and hacking the fine lines...</p>
<p>the most prevalent and genius iq hack for ppl is to paint their 'targets' as - hackable or hacked = capability / intellect / intents</p>
<p>the ultimate hack = delusional</p>
<p>the times we live in, logical arguments and even words, seem to 'hurt'</p>
<p>so feelings - are often prioritized</p>
<p>matrix - the 4th one....the lizards did make this point - they shifted a binary matrix to 'feelings' based - grey 1 - everyone thinks 'guilt' yet capitalism/time must flow...</p>
<p>greys - everywhere, though lizards would have their ways anyway...</p>
<p>booglie/personal recap of side effects of 0</p>
<p>ppl show themselves - they put in their final verdict...</p>
<p>for me, it was 'delusional/disturbed'</p>
<p>it flew...</p>
<p>i was 0...so i dint know....i felt...but debugging is about being sure.</p>
<p>0 became 0--, as ppl-=ppl loop continued...</p>
<p>0...has a weird power...to see from a 0....the opportunities...appear.</p>
<p>they are different from your perception of being N</p>
<p>=&gt;logically, one becomes 0 from N...so definitely perception/opportunities are different.</p>
<p>they change as 'intents' show themselves...</p>
<p>thats the real investment of time, life....</p>
<p>ideas, viability on / of ppl...will keep on evolving...</p>
<p>the key is patience/time - life of 0</p>
<p>faith/belief/religion - whatever 1's true 0 is ...remains with them</p>
<p>and then ...power of 0</p>
<p>its awesome coz - its u.</p>
<p>it really doesnt matter what 10000 or 1000000 say.</p>
<p>1 is what made them...0s come in plenty 😀 </p>

<p>the perception game is just not personal - UN, Muskie, WHO - they all use this 'perception' of being 'good' to do to most 'constructive' work in the world....it is only logical that N meets this choice = aligning to lizard ring of destitution or become 0..</p>
<p>our corp leaders - product of these brands - made by them, know their worth is evaluated by media - hollow/intel inside kind 'leaders' - indian/global -- pappus.</p>
