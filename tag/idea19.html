<p>logic of all of this</p>
<p>I ve seen "good" people choosing silence/inaction due to repercussions of speaking out - money, in many forms</p>
<p>The reason i shared my origins - for most of my life, i was made to believe that what my grandad did - was not necessary and evil</p>
<p>Ppl were divided - no one dared asked my Grandad, but judgements were made</p>
<p>Those judgements influenced a lot of ppl - me too</p>
<p>I chose way of my father - education - whatever drew my interest</p>
<p>I saw a division of an idea of "Hindu/Indian" - which had extreme bearing on me</p>
<p>We are reliving the same choice - all of us</p>
<p>Option - this wont and cant happen</p>
<p>I have seen stories, things which i was told to be not proud of...but then, education and morales - they dont seem to apply to green ppl - just the taxpayers - the ppl who slog it out to provide for..</p>
<p>yet, just a sheep </p>
<ul>
<li>money and its value is too apparent to - ppl in kashmir, now israel and some alive ancestors in Delhi too </li>
</ul>
<p>Our former PM (Pv Narasimha Rao) made a very beautiful statement - not making a decision is also making a decision</p>
<p>conversely - not speaking out is also a decision.</p>
<p>silence only emboldens the bully - a former bully knows.</p>

                <p>Hack-ability of consumer electronics - the "techie" stuff</p>
<p>No matter how "open source" you go - the final frontier has always been the "invisible os" or the processor which you dont and cant control</p>
<p>In laptops/computers - it is the bios</p>
<p>In Phones - it is the baseband - the chip which ideally should be just doing the rf-digital-analog modem thing</p>
<p>But it does way, way more</p>
<p>the basic services - sms etc - will always have flaws - the "rf payload" is decoded, executed at these "invisible processors" running a closed source os</p>
<p>There are some partially known ways to interact - some of them are documented, most of them are not. One of the known ways to "hack a baseband" is to know the layers -</p>
<p>qmi </p>
<p>ril</p>
<p>baseband</p>
<p>uknown or reverse engineer-able. </p>
<p>Get a cert, hack a room would only get you this far - it is capitalism using your "hacks" to hack you  - a new brick - a new kind of huuumaaan.</p>
