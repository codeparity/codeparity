<p>It wont ever happen - The glory of resurrecting a decades old concept with the razzmatazz of real life iron man - people are virtually in love with these "voluntary sign-offs of their will" - so called modern life, to become modern sheep</p>
<p>it is the iphone story all over again - people craving for society approval and endorsing a company which makes "no bones" about creating a "closed ecosystem"</p>
<p>the closed ecosystem leads to 15 minute cities - at mercy of ppl who make "no bones" about their "intents" - and hey, i absolutely believe in their book - history is totally spot on - you got to admire the simplicity of algorithm.</p>
<p>so the green ppl create fear, the messiahs solve for fear - using tech</p>
<p>this all leads to a good world - where anyone can be anyone in metaverse</p>

<p>....all the world is sorted ...the "feeling" is the ultimate hack - and muskie is on target to hit that</p>
<p>i like my real dopamine, not a video game, cgi induced "kick" which some rich billionaire delegates an ai to scale.</p>
<p>nueralink is the literal "matrix" connector - we are the generation which plugs itself in.</p>

<p>It is not fear exactly, but a sort of decision "fatigue" which the "leaders" of the world keep exhausting us with - unable to regain focus or think for us, rather than on "job"</p>
<p>There are people and organizations which have things "handled" - welcome to a world of our making</p>
<p>=&gt;this would be the first global generation which would actually fail the nature course of progress, prosperity, enrichment via evolution, learning, time </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eg, the next generation would really own less of - land, gold, food </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dependent on vax, free money, and artificial food and supply</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So keep those likes and those "atta bois" to yourself - lick them, treasure them as your stars of "compliance" </p>
<p>a stray is about to show what "impact" few "stray/unapproved" values/ideas can create - holy batman you are in for a fight.</p>
<p>Values = New Capitalistic religion</p>
<p>Material = "free/sustainable" energy - distributed istyle so "genius" kind cannot put it behind "human safety" concerns - as "leaders" will end up doing with AI, as done with nuclear</p>
<p>Btw, why nuclear waste disposal on moon, or in a black hole is a 'bad idea'? when all nations do is dump their waste on each other??</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have unfollowed so many of you...and it was for a purpose - i dont really care, and it should tell all of you something - we were never in the same league</p>
<p>Humility should not be confused with "subservience"/inferiority or equivalence</p>
<p>thats all for "linkedin" - i will see ppl in real world now....caz it takes less time to "show magic" rather than "talk magic"</p>
<p>i am no jerusalem historian faking as futurist,</p>
<p>i am just a stray engineer who really unlearned and learned...if it is not showing in words, it will show in "impact"</p>
<p>🙏 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In honor of open source, even ideas or fairness in a decent world - search CIA declassified files on free energy </p>
<p>Thats why UAP are different from UFOs?</p>
<p>DArpa controls innovation - ever wondered why we waste 2 bytes even today? in a world where bit packing seemed to rule a real engineers life</p>
<p>lets see who really cracks it - it is all in the design baby!</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The folks at xprojects at b00Gle might be the stupidest collection of people on planet</p>
<p>or i will make them look like one when i am done🤣</p>
