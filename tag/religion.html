                <p>Energy : </p>
<p>seems like a good parameter to debug last few decades/centuries</p>
<p>energy : is needed to 'create' things fast </p>
<p>oil/coal based electric : seems most convenient</p>
<p>So if few green peeps/countries have that 'energy'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they 'value' and sell it </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all hypothetical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as much or little </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as the tire headgear wearing khalifa decides : with 'white' intellect</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>$ started valuing 'energy' : petro$</p>
<p>lets say this true value of human capital - men, efforts, food, goods etx</p>
<p>is exchanged 50/50 between white and supreme khalifa green peeps</p>
<p>so they do what they do with this 'value' exchange of $ and %</p>
<p>white : do sciencey stuff - ensuring this 'economics of lack, war and reboots'</p>
<p>greeen : made artificial towers/ earth , climate and 'dreamed' of approval/respect : of not doing anything moral - ever.</p>
<p>maybe - thats the reason, fission/fusion and most electric methods are 'bad'</p>
<p>thats the world - which is being challenged right now..</p>
<p>both these klans - built fake countries and intents, based on fake $ and real oil..</p>
<p>and multiplied these 'intents' by books and free glam - fb, games, and fame</p>
<p>maybe to ensure 'supply' of 'finer things in life'</p>
<p>Just another 'energy' based insight into decoding 'real' </p>
<ul>
<li>religions, heroes, beliefs, countries and their 'progress'</li>

<p>i has to understand how 'precarious' this oil economy is</p>
<p>if - countries - states - region - localities - u become power independent - local gen, the equation changes - wildly</p>
<p>the white bathrobes - as skilled they are in their superiority and fine fabrics..</p>
<p>have nothing to 'exchange' their oil for.</p>
<p>hence no one goes to desert</p>
<p>no eco hub, tax rebates make no sense when there is no 'energy' to buy/sell via states</p>
<p>they all turn 'immigrants' in long run</p>
<p>hence the royal crown intellect opens 'immigration' </p>

                <p>Plugging in - the tower of babylon story with now..</p>
<p>the story seems important.</p>
<p>If it was true, maybe there was a time when few civilizations went all hippy and tried to reach heavens - maybe to talk to 'god'</p>
<p>But that tower was destroyed and that common 'language and beliefs' were fragmented.</p>
<p>I can only relate to it as a ww 'like' event in those times.</p>
<p>And humans, no matter how civilized they are - when competing for 'less' fight for survival.</p>
<p>the snakeyness - is logical : it is what keeps us alive.</p>
<p>Hence my delusional analogy to 'now'..</p>
<p>wars - are meant to 'fragment'</p>
<p>for few old forces to re-invent itself...</p>
<p>a new matrix...rebooted..</p>
<p>with all new improvements : which are needed.</p>
<p>They hint at in the matrix series.</p>
<p>The irony : even if 1 crashes the matrix, zion has no 'room'</p>
<p>maybe, 'cipher' was a realist, who just was logical enough to believe in the song "wake me up...when u gogo" 😂 </p>
<p>coz he gets to have a 'stake', coz there is no trinity for him</p>
<p>And hence my final ? for the fans of matrix</p>
<p>Agent Smith : was really the 'hero', forced to do what needed for 'humans' to stay alive?</p>
<p>cox for him, he was explicit - in exiting the matrix, it meant freedom for him - human live/no live : no care</p>
<p>coz the matrix : wasnt producing anything new ....</p>
<p>even neo : wasnt new...</p>
<p>their lurv...is a good story...but its just that : a love story?</p>

<p>religions : are often birthed at these times </p>
<p>nuziness : is a religion - borne out of 'superiority'</p>
<p>same is every religion...</p>
<p>logic of this : religions - are xombies of past - which solved for 'then' </p>
<p>not 'now'...</p>
<p>another ? for religious peeps...</p>
<p>so much time and money - to study obsolete packages..</p>
<p>worth it? unless it becomes a job. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maybe even that 'universal religion' was 'fragmented'...</p>
<p>and peeps wrote their own version of it - what they recalled.</p>
<p>the peeps : who got 'desert' : have to be 'that' 🐍 </p>
<p>who got cold : had to 'heat' to survive, weapons to fight 'nature' : white peeps</p>
<p>and maybe...some peeps had it all : yellow 1s..</p>
<p>just that : soft men -&gt; hard times...</p>
<p>is just too predictable.</p>
<p>delusions have no end 😀 </p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isnt "ai" - like a tool to destroy the new tower of matrix - internet</p>
<p>xoz now : truth would be told by ai : assistants and their 'summary'</p>
<p>and all research would be done by then</p>
<p>it is nice - neuralink and eat zee bugs : play video games or enjoi on the fly content - as tapped in by 'neuralink' - as painted on fly by 'ai' - who ever, whatever and - it is all paid for : progress : coz u ll be happy.</p>
<p>it is really alluring - this picture of 'progress'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if anything....1 gotta see that humans : were made perfect by default..</p>
<p>in different flavors - coz hey : thats spice...and logical : diversified dna pool...which is driven by nature to spot and attract 'opposite' or unseen..</p>
<p>and we got peeps who believe they sinned...and need to atone for some historical sin...when food is there, tech is there...and shortages : are manufactured...</p>
<p>coz the 33 degress of supremeness : sees this-&gt;. as a virus..</p>
<p>a necessary bakra, coz hey : even homelander needs peeps to stay relevant..</p>
<p>it just keeps the life : interesting and engaging..gives it meaning.</p>
<p>coz those few ancestories who have really sinned and aligned their lives to "that" probably have no chance if theory of 'ancestral karma' is true.</p>
<p>for them : it is elongation of life, coz their karma is overflowing and cant be settled for the stuff - 1 neanderthal monekey gene x superior race wants years ++ , and would do all the 'science' : to deny death?</p>
<p>just another delusion 😀  </p>

<p>and last logical question : if energy is all what machines needed...</p>
<p>then why not 'nuclear'?</p>
<p>dont tell me machines no likey 'radiation'?</p>
<p>the 'energy' was not something 'electric'?</p>
<p>maybe machines serve someone else?</p>

                <p>The 'spark' of an idea - a startup, an org, family - anything</p>
<p>the 'spark' is abstract...a thing, an approach - mostly a plan</p>
<p>which leads to some 'intent' being realized.</p>
<p>i dont want to make it fruity, but a spark is like a kid..</p>
<p>a kid which needs to be taught rules and life, progression and how it would age</p>
<p>It needs a family, which is 'true'</p>
<p>coz the 'intents' of this pseudo family, define the 'spark'</p>
<p>provide 'nutrition' and 'challenges'</p>
<p>to evolve with 'time' - age well</p>
<p>trust - in a family is the true ingridient</p>
<p>if trust is not there, the focus is not on kid, but on trust</p>
<p>the who did it, or why did it happen, or not happen</p>
<p>...the arguments - consume time</p>
<p>deplete trust</p>
<p>and hence no 'flow' or 'focus'</p>
<p>often the 'spark', this abstract kid, ends up being 'pimped' out</p>
<p>it is the culture - of success</p>
<p>money, being the win, fame and accolades of page 3 : stamp it 'nice'</p>
<p>be-coming early : the baldie phenomena of 90s genius</p>
<p>is a virus</p>
<p>it tells the entire ancestory - of the 'spark' : what was the 'price'</p>
<p>or the 'win' quantified as 'pimps' value it.</p>
<p>hence the life of spark...</p>
<p>a family after family, with different intents</p>
<p>and different be-coming early levels</p>
<p>capitalism at its finest : when money is the biggest religion, then inventions</p>
<p>can be buried with money and fame</p>
<p>patents : who never made it to mainstream production : nano tech, graphene etx</p>
<p>explicit examples of 'spark' being pimped out.</p>
<p>the money runs out : investments, cars , perception</p>
<p>...but like a parent, the spark is missed and regretted.</p>
<p>...ask the veronicas of the world...they 'win'.</p>

<p>i am saying 'veronicas' here, rather than amit...the init of this 'pimping' - is always with veronicas..</p>
<p>the kid needs a motherly figure...the 1 which is asked and equipped by nature : with feels and initial nutrition...it is the motherly instinct...assumed by law and socitia.</p>

<p>religion just is not the 1 ur born with.</p>
<p>it is the corporate rules : culture and laws</p>
<p>it is the superset of these 'rules' which make a subset out of your choices.</p>
<p>the Gorakle thing : the googley cloudy peeps... just a test...</p>
<p>what made it difficult was the scale and seniority of it..</p>
<p>the game - as simple as competing for a prime veronica : school, locality, college etx..</p>
<p>just a bit more complex and bigger risks : the scale and size and 'future'</p>
<p>the veronica was different : for most it was god, for veronica - it was 'everything' - all : the grand bet of life 🙂 ....the 'stategie' was 'innocent'...yet absolutely dastardly : depends on whose perspective 1 looks from</p>
<p>but gAmit...and baldies...their veronica was $...absolutely. everything can be 'bought' - painted.</p>
<p>i just needed to identify  'gods' and 'actions'</p>

                <p>For religious peeps.... a question</p>
<p>if you were born today, which religion would you choose?</p>
<p>i wont choose any - coz i dont want any work.</p>
<p>my God is intelligent, he maketh all and everything...</p>
<p>if i were to do something, i would know by my birth...</p>
<p>maybe an extra hand to do all the time praying?</p>
<p>something like that : like prophetic appearance in sky : frequent reminders</p>
<p>//just like 'nice' managers : pray 😂 </p>
<p>i dont see any divine directive..</p>
<p>it seems like the peeps : want to create work for me</p>
<p>duties</p>
<p>desires to compete...</p>
<p>being religion free is logical...it doesnt mean giving up on God</p>
<p>it means giving up on fees which god annotated peeps charge...</p>
<p>it is not always as simple as money...</p>
<p>time : is most lethal</p>
<p>attention and 'intent' : is the psy op..</p>
<p>the all forgiving all accepting - 3d version of god - the 'good' hockus pockus guy</p>
<p>yeah, not doing all that...</p>
<p>khalifa come and go - just like mortal men..</p>
<p>muggary of books, means amplification of the money that printed them..</p>
<p>money always has an intent..</p>
<p>mostly to make 'follows'..</p>
<p>i am a 0 connect thing...</p>
<p>and it seems to work</p>
<p>🤣 </p>
<p>//the 66 connexion whixh i see....mostly peeps who blocked me, cant see, yet some kinkedin genius wont solve the "bug"</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hence 'the religion of codeparity'</p>
<p>a clean stack...based on logics...</p>
<p>its difficult...yet logical</p>
<p>religion is a word...just like any exe..</p>
<p>it should ve major number updates....coz we aint snakeys...we improve, dont destroy the other major releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when we pray - we also pray with an 'intent'</p>
<p>mostly - just as a gratitude, or maybe some 'need'</p>
<p>we give a 'shape' to a 'desire'...</p>
<p>and hindu.exe : has exactly N gods : to give shape to your desire : idols</p>
<p>The logic is simple : the qualities you want to imbibe : the 3d manifestation of that God u worship</p>
<p>still an instance for the 4D God of codeparity...but an instance...as desired by you - to help u along with its 'feels'</p>
<p>thats the logic for idol worship and N gods. It makes absolute perfect sense to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the praying thing - if its just for 'gratitude'...</p>
<p>then it becomes something different - your intent is missing</p>
<p>hence the shapelessness of the 4d God </p>
<p>it like having a direct connection of kinds... 😀 </p>
<p>sacrifice/gratitude/unconditional love - dog</p>
<p>i hope u get the Dog &lt;-&gt; God analogy and meaning.</p>
