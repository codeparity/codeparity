<p>unfortunately : the popular version of hindu.exe is also reduced to 'animistic' layer 1 : due to inaction </p>
<p>a mind F hack of psy op : gandhian and hard inforced by law</p>
<p>a law, which neuters instances of hindu.exe to forgo wars, ignore much - to hold on to that corporate job, where they can escape this - go to a 'fair; country like 'ca' 'au' etx</p>

<p>thats how i know a veronica and amit</p>
<p>confident peeps : born in comfort yet aware of the 'fall' : perception</p>
<p>title : defines what kinda choices they make : it should 'appear' in sync with 'title' : page 3 / instagram thing.</p>
<p>it is quite a protected upbringing : the fear of loses/hurt : to preserve ego and most importantly : the perception of success</p>
<p>titles are a real burden : if 1 is a private person.</p>
<p>but leaders : are assumed to be confident yet public peeps.</p>
<p>ironically : most of the really successful peeps : private persons.</p>

<p>It is the layer of existence</p>
<p>the snakeyness - is the nihilistic layer</p>
<p>the lizard brain : the one which do as it sees</p>
<p>a servant of senses.</p>
<p>btw - snake lays egss. </p>
<p>ie not even in same class - mammals</p>
<dl>
<dt>the next layer : how we plan or think</dt>
<dd>
<p>conscious, deliberate thought...</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>ie intelligence and its limit - mammals.</p>
<p>this is where hyena/wolfie and other animals instinct kick in.</p>
<p>this is over and over snakey/nihilistic layers.</p>
<p>the 'strategies' and the 'reaction' built in by 'default'</p>
<p>2000 years of 'human evolution'</p>
<p>yet - we have 1 % ruling the 'democraxy'</p>
<p>it becomes clear : we are lead by 'apex' of different kinds,</p>
<p>which defines education, activities and 'holidays' too</p>
<p>if i am 1% - brit neanderthal money croxx incestual intelligence..</p>
<p>then, its pretty clear : what would 1 % do...</p>
<p>they design 'mirages' : of enlightenment, money and wars.</p>
<p>hence this ?</p>
<p>do we even 'think' </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>just 'recall' what someone 'dead long ago' thought?</p>
<p>genius : is knowing a lot of books - who said what and when</p>
<p>or </p>
<p>it is knowing what needs be done 'now' and hence in 'future'</p>
<p>coz, baba has it 'pre-calculated' 😂 </p>
<p>religion - ultimately tell us : there is no choice</p>
<p>and there is. </p>
<p>hence this.</p>

<p>i am guessing - past civilization were quite smart.</p>
<p>they talked in 'symbology'</p>
<p>hence 'thoth'</p>
<p>the 1 who has head of a bird : eyes of eagle and beak as mouth</p>
<p>symbology : being precision and he sees all - from a wider lens</p>
<p>..maybe eats less : just like a bird. definitely 'light' enough</p>
<p>same symbology : is apparent in different N hindu Gods.</p>
<p>we just see - different : coz we are taught different : from centuries, in daily survival of 'nihilism' -food/job/etx.</p>

<p>intoxication : substance abuse...</p>
<p>starts with 'plant stuff'...</p>
<p>but like any addiction, 1 focussed on next high?</p>
<p>remember : a junkie likies when he touches life/death line...</p>
<p>Overdose : a typical char of a junkie..</p>
<p>what would the ultimate junkie do? </p>
<p>what is the ultimate poison ? rarest 1? natural 1?</p>
<p>snakey juice?</p>
<p>it is ... and it is there where it gets twisted..</p>
<p>this life/death boundary stuff : called near death exp..is all enlightening and knowing.</p>
<p>but, 1 doesnt have to be a baba to know this - any adreno junkie is doing the same stuff - legal/illegal is just a perspective.

<p>To really dig deep into the sigmaness of gAmit and his poorer clones - gTurds</p>
<p>1 need not even think a bit...</p>
<p>its simple:</p>
<p>It is a short term need to end : a day at 1</p>
<p>Addictions of 'mind' : makes you addicted to 'cheap' wins</p>
<p>dopamine addiction - happiness addiction : all relative to saturation levels 1s sensors have reached</p>
<p>an activity - any : professional/personal : needs to elevate in 'experience'</p>
<p>it may be cycling, or just expectation of wins..</p>
<p>or just expectations of expectations : the self farts which baldies smell</p>
<p>In their minds - they start at 1 and end at 1++</p>
<p>not ever returning to 0</p>
<p>thats being 'high' or being 'addicted'</p>
<p>when 'salaries' are just 'entitlements' and baldies : playing the bigger switcharoo within industry baldies..</p>
<p>the values and decisions : rarely coherent</p>
<p>when bijness is slow, gossips run wild</p>
<p>entertainment is just making up delusions...</p>
<p>and delusions...tend to come true.</p>

<p>i did - 4 years back.</p>
<p>and 100x geniuses did - based on G money.</p>
<p>exciting and expected...yet would unroll slowly with time...</p>
<p>God makes his presence known in very hockusy pockusy ways.. 😉</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wishes - what are they?</p>
<p>Who listens to them? Who do we imagine when we make them?</p>
<p>God, a comet, an eyelash?</p>
<p>or a baba?</p>
<p>i can fairly assume - that intellect which made us : is supremely intelligent.</p>
<p>He/She might ve created few forces - to make a 'soul' experience life...</p>
<p>but then...there are always 'hackers'.. who hack everything - to gain 'something'</p>
<p>Prayers - are no different</p>
<p>Knowing your prayers - is the most ignored aspect of religion/god.</p>
<p>If 1 delegates even that wish to something unknown - I think it would be noticed...and karma would be adjusted.</p>
<p>There is no morality in all this..</p>
<p>i think hockus pockus is like a debt, which just like capitalism and %, needs to be paid back - and 1 needs to make something with this 'debt'</p>
<p>a bet - which 1 makes on himselves - with his will and time/money/faith..</p>
<p>but money peeps, take it as a tool.</p>
<p>thats why...these baldies - are in for 'big results' - in delusional layers of logic. 😀 </p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i tried reading into 33 degress of masonary bleh blah...</p>
<p>all bs for make them believe - in superiority, justification of their 'know' &gt; soul wishes of others - an entitlement</p>
<p>seems offensive, but hindu.exe is no different 😂 </p>
<p>just 'genius' nepo babies - peddling glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gossip = lowest level of 3d wishes/words/spells</p>
<p>it is predictable, when gossip backfires - the 'teller' loses his voice and power</p>
<p>thats the most 3d example of this 'hockus pockus' of words / wishes.</p>
