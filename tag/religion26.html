                <p>I had to take 2-3 years.</p>
<p>Logic</p>
<p>Avg tenure</p>
<p>Eco cycle - $$ recession</p>
<p>Strength of baldies - using others politeness, manners to their advantage</p>
<p>And my personal goals - body, mind</p>
<p>I went into G thinking that wars are over - finally some pure 'creation' time - the so called 'gCulture' of 20% projects, nice ppl and all that 'publicity' stuff</p>
<p>Then you get to meet the baldies which are not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>No startup exp</p>
<p>All lalas of different cultures trying to become Alfred[] at 50+</p>
<p>Doing all muskie, billy and other stereotype bakwaas - when they are on a 'job'</p>
<p>Technically, there should be no 'friction', a win of an engineer works out better for the manager...</p>
<p>reality, is v v different - it seems a sort of subservience - an engineer cannot 'innovate', the 'leader' (the wannabe, neverbeen, not an engineer, absolute weight on earth) should 'innovate'</p>
<p>This is quite simple to understand, if you really dissect the word - manager.</p>
<p>What does a manager manage?</p>
<p>Talented/skilled people</p>
<p>he guides them, synchronized them </p>
<p>=&gt; times the individual output to the final assembly.</p>
<p>Yet, a typical manager - does nothing of that kind</p>
<p>-created work to create his 'identity'</p>
<p>-has to bully his team, if there is nothing he can do</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This used to be called 'brokering' when the work doesnt involve humans.</p>
<p>When it involves humans, it becomes something outrageous, unacceptable.</p>
<p>Yet, it is the 'desired' position.</p>

<p>oh - these ppl called up recruiters to make fake offers - from their companies, called up all the baldies - to 'make sure i am known'...and the veronica bit -jobless...and lots of time..</p>
<p>so i just chilled...created a religion, created a few ips , few 'things' and just few bigger ideas...</p>
<p>baldie retirement is just a small perk - gotta savor them...kiran uses clout to great effect...will take some from him - akuma istyle.</p>

<p>Good/Bad</p>
<p>i really dont know absolute good or bad.</p>
<p>people try, then  hindsight makes people and prophets look 'genius'</p>
<p>I am trying to understand this boundary of good|bad</p>
<p>In nihilism - it is meaningless - just a body's desires as decided by reality and lure of 'feelings' based half of brain - akin to $$++</p>
<p>In medieval times - material might - abduls rules</p>
<p>in 'modern' times - logical might - alfreds rule.</p>
<p>No one can define 'progress' </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>rightfully claim 'good' </p>
<p>unless they cite the holy book or religion </p>
<ul>
<li>the wrongs done by some neanderthal as written by another neanderthal - all near to monkey intellect - $ science tells us that.</li>
</ul>
<p>holy books are not just religion - they are the rule books</p>
<p>name changes, intent doesnt</p>
<p>-religion in medieval times</p>
<p>-science in 'industrialized times'</p>
<p>-'education' in current 'peak' times</p>
<p>all that blah blah - to pose some Q's</p>
<p>who can define good and bad?</p>
<p>leaders know?</p>
<p>preachers/influencers/karma deciders - do they know?</p>
<p>i dont think anyone knows anything - the maya or matrix is 1s understanding and relevance in matrix</p>
<p>just like the hypothetical 'devil/shaitaan/daitya' manifests itself via its hacks - lust, gluttony etc</p>
<p>God, would manifest itself in similar ways - the hacks - temptation to devil.</p>
<p>As above - so below.</p>
<p>all this is known, yet forgotten - newton, karma, nature : it is a universal fact -  each religion agrees.</p>
<ul>
<li>devil and his hacks seem to have executed a DDOS via glam, shimmer, success....</li>
</ul>
<p>the null pointer - i think it manifests in certain conditions....in every habitus.</p>
<p>i gave examples of g_baldie_1 - someone who lost his pointer to 'good' in 'society'</p>
<p>the other 1, of God manifesting itself </p>
<ul>
<li>is when we can really 'work' - free of bias, fear and everything</li>
</ul>
<p>i feel everyone knows this feeling...maybe work, hobby, music or just someone's company.</p>
<p>Dido - the unofficial angel of this hypothetical religion </p>
<ul>
<li>she becomes an angel when she performs/inspires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i dont think the 'feeling' comes from a human - just via a human.</p>
<p>did she need to do yoga or subscribe to antics of iron man? 😀 </p>
<p>she knows her 1s and it shows.</p>
<ul>
<li>her journey is interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>i think she was 'discovered' when she tried to 'steal' a musical instrument - the start of a 0</p>
<p>Tx and tc.</p>

                <p>if u have the unfortunate experience of getting hooked into a 'nerdy/ratty' version of online big boss...</p>
<p>my apologies.</p>
<p>i started writing a series of emails to my son. something he can have access to when he is 18+</p>
<p>The 'loss' of a fatherfigure - akin to base layer of emotional and material experience - exposes u - the 0s.</p>
<p>I had to work through my life - 'reverse engineering' most social constructs after my  loss</p>
<p>in 2003 - the year i dint know if i earned that 'degree' </p>
<ul>
<li>most habitus of engineering/familia - verdict was given </li>
</ul>
<p>0--</p>
<p>this can happen to anyone - a real possibility, considering me, my ways, values and 'bent' limits...</p>
<p>hence the emails.</p>
<p>started writing those emails - became googler after another 0</p>
<ul>
<li>it meant dealing with 'genius' - the time and energy vampires...</li>
</ul>
<p>i realized the truth which every father realized later - the pattern...how out of time all this would sound - the world and its 'truth' - is only relative to religion, $ and 'intents' of masters and alfreds with abduls on standby...</p>
<p>Sounding 'delusional' was a real concern - a typical 'age-gap' thing.</p>
<p>debugging this 'pattern' - makes you really spiral...what should i really 'tell, time, words' - context...</p>
<p>thats how a stray...ventured into history, religion and all...</p>
<p>i dint go into gory details of nepotism - who did what and when - just the 'impact' it had - capitalism, psy/op on society -&gt; habits -&gt; morality -&gt; trends -&gt;  $$++</p>
<p>it is really not that 'genius'.</p>
<p>the debug - critical thinking</p>
<p>=&gt; 'delusional' - if only 1 does it</p>
<p>==&gt; 'failure' - if 1 persists with it 😂 - its an addiction - tinfoil ppl and all </p>
<p>the patch</p>
<p>=&gt; debug 'intents'</p>
<p>==&gt; critical thinking - life is programmed for it - survival and all</p>
<p>rest - every 0 has 1s which are not brick++</p>
<p>jobs - they are $ balance - your 8 hours of 'low', to have 8 hours of 'life'</p>
<p>everything else - alfred baazi</p>
<p>Hope u learnt - i sure hope my son does, and he is not alone - if 'critical thinking' is really alive.</p>
<p>ppl can just say nay - to neuralink and larger pale lizard brit unkle's pediatric designs</p>
<p>G is an example - i hope this blahBlah - made u learn something.</p>
<p>hack - is the serpant - ppl 'fear' it, for me - another lifeform</p>
<p>respect in parity.</p>

<p>though i seem to be making a joke out of few baldies - in truth they do have few good qualities - some v v skilled...yet $$ motivation and 'comfort' keeps them 'kings' of their ponds - some of them are quite big....their hope seem to be sell out when $$ comes up - it is just work routing on 'priority' really - sometimes its code, sometimes its ppl - its really doesn't matter as long as the smiles are there after a 'release'</p>

<p>lets define "mentor" : a guy who 'creates' more opportunities for the 'pupil' - now and for future - a true unpaid teacher.</p>
<p>pupil : a guy who is humble enough to pursue a 'skill', gratuitous enough to ack the transaction to 'mentor'</p>

                <p>Mathematical induction and Religion</p>
<p>Every religion has a central figure - a God alias : the deemed 'God'</p>
<p>If i give example of any other 'religion' - blasphemy risks - abdul or alfred might get triggered..</p>
<p>so i ll use mine - Hinduism and its nepotistic 'tool' - perceived deemed 'God' - Manu</p>
<p>Manu = 1</p>
<p>where is 0?</p>
<p>We need 0s - mathematically/logically or even materially. Where is 'egg'???</p>
<p>It fails for n=0</p>
<p>n=1</p>
<p>yet it scales for N, N+1...to infinity ( or need for control - political, ideological and material )</p>
<p>Political control - what happens now.</p>
<p>Ideological/Religious control - the abstract intent (vector of society)</p>
<p>Material - the enforcement arms - judges, police, leaders.</p>
<p>Who wrote 'ManuSmriti'?</p>
<p>Manu?</p>
<p>Was he all read and able without 0?</p>
<p>how did he break the 'fibonacchi sequence'?</p>
<p>hermaphrodite?</p>
<p>Or just a feminine hating narcissist? </p>
<p>or just like abdul or alfred?</p>
<p>Texts written by man - interpreted by a man, when 'reading' was 'restricted'.</p>
<p>My intent.</p>
<p>My runtime has always been memory/cpu constraints by these java programs - they think memory management doesn't exist, coz lower order $ capitalism programs like me/us/0s - do it for them.</p>
<p>There is much to dissect - but lets enjoy the gFireworks - what happens when java mindset rises and 'wins'.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>manu is just a variable in this iteration of 'matrix'</p>
<p>even abdul/afreds run the same algos - just that the wave of $$ changes - the grand illusion of 'change - blue is bad, red is good' - reps - dems, abdul - alfred, etc...</p>
<p>not so different - just different languages and 'timing'</p>
<p>internet - global connectivity = 21st century - tower of babel</p>
<p>the ppl who run this tower - the boogles, the zamazons, whatever, oil, shinzinpin etc... they know this.</p>
<p>they just want their version of nihilistic 'vision' over yours - sheep of different religions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the leaders, self proclaimed 'mentors'....mine are definitely not without 'self bias', some have appropriated words, intents, ambitions, ideas .... just like an any alfred..</p>
<p>it doesnt work - the religion is complete and independent - its parts dont compute in isolation - so being a hindu and copying this. = doesnt work.</p>
<p>intents = joker here - wont help anyone become $$...</p>
<p>it is gnu - gpl of 'intents'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh there are new 'prophets' or hackers of 'hinduism' ..in order of 'impact'</p>
<p>home minister and progeny</p>
<p>the newly bhagwa businessmen and hindu alfreds</p>
<p>the renaissance 'social media cool peeps' - the rs 500 book writers/ new = Intellect(type HINDU)...</p>
<p>proud ++ </p>
<p>all forgetting the very logical question - if it was so great and all - why did it fall?</p>
<p>then they resort to 'sanatan' coz casteism comes in when 'manusmriti' comes up...</p>
<p>then - the base layer of written text - the vedas</p>
<p>appropriated as 'hindu', now alias 'sanatan' - to get the max vote of sikhism jainism etc...</p>
<p>something 'perfect' works - it is resilient - just like distributed systems eg = earth - the food, the life</p>
<p>sun = time immortal</p>
<ul>
<li>the roots of my 'hindusim' - popular 'Hinduism'</li>
</ul>
<p>so 'CodeParity' = no perceived intellectual inferiority/superiority</p>
<p>it is 10x approach = it works in business - a reboot, no sequels. 😀 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wrote some blah about using 'tech' to establish 'parity' - codeparity...</p>
<p>working thorough the 'wheel of emotions' - yours : to tap into 'emotions' - traversing through it - using logic/work.....</p>
<p>i did mention - emotions are result of a 'transaction' - $ is just a symbol - the material part - emotion equation works like maths or %</p>
<p>time -&gt; interest &amp;&amp; 'karma' - the abstract invisible real abstract 'score' ....</p>
<p>the g_baldies[] are learning this ...december is a month of celebration - equinox</p>
<p>though - somewhere the light is dimming....0 sum games..often end like this ... oldies + ego = 'genius egoistical mammoth cockroach jar with king cockroach taking a v v public and 0 fall' - with no 'alternatives'..</p>
<p>should ve been more intelligent...maybe even more years ...like 10,20+ years...</p>
<p>naah - wont have mattered...the higher they r. the louder they fall</p>
