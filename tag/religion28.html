<p>Why 'music' is very important </p>
<ul>
<li>central pillar of 'feelings'  - the trigger which makes $ capitalism - buy!</li>
</ul>
<p>cia/dhs etc </p>
<ul>
<li>the enforcement arm of masters - are the pioneers in the idea...</li>
</ul>
<p>religion of codeparity understands this 'input' and its hacks...</p>
<p>music can be a powerful tool to jump emotional states or explore more answers ...</p>
<p>...both halfs of brain</p>
<p>human brain = logic + feels</p>
<ul>
<li>balance - one ness.</li>
</ul>
<p>ai is just logic.</p>
<p>can mimic emotion - its just voice modulation and servo moters to produce 'expressions' - a path of execution taken off from specific inputs - no different from any other output.</p>

<p>they 'assume' something...i dont assume anything....hacking at this 'level' requires walking few fine lines - undetectable by 70 iq genius.</p>
<p>The "impact" has been due for some decades </p>
<p>....music connects you to people you never can know...its not fandom...it is an intersection of 0s</p>
<p>Chester Bennington/ Linkin Park is a rabbit hole in itself....</p>
<p>the 'feelings' in those compositions is 'raw, unadulterated'</p>

<p>5G - seems to be a touchy subject...as a former telecom/satcom engg....it is not about the protocols, the air interface and all - it is all good, shall lead to better connectivity..</p>
<p>the devil is in the frequencies...wifi/2g made 'official sparrows' dissapear from delhi...yet no genius would 'spot' it...</p>
<p>sar, frequency absorption, trees - they all form an ecosystem which needs much study before allocation...the frequency range is a problem...as are the alleged graphene particles in vax, good alfred food etc..</p>

<p>music - healing - peace - physical healing  - all seem connected...solfeggio frequencies is real, proven science - yet hidden, with no one making anything on it...</p>

<p>I wont describe it, just put it in contrast to 'logic' of policy making...</p>
<p>if something is true for n=0, n=1, N, N+1 - something real programmers (C/C++...) really use to scope out the perf of their programs</p>

<p>Masters - they hacked feelings to reboot the matrix....</p>

                <p>Delusions, beliefs and perception = truth</p>
<p>this is a personal discovery - walking and hacking the fine lines...</p>
<p>the most prevalent and genius iq hack for ppl is to paint their 'targets' as - hackable or hacked = capability / intellect / intents</p>
<p>the ultimate hack = delusional</p>
<p>the times we live in, logical arguments and even words, seem to 'hurt'</p>
<p>so feelings - are often prioritized</p>
<p>matrix - the 4th one....the lizards did make this point - they shifted a binary matrix to 'feelings' based - grey 1 - everyone thinks 'guilt' yet capitalism/time must flow...</p>
<p>greys - everywhere, though lizards would have their ways anyway...</p>
<p>booglie/personal recap of side effects of 0</p>
<p>ppl show themselves - they put in their final verdict...</p>
<p>for me, it was 'delusional/disturbed'</p>
<p>it flew...</p>
<p>i was 0...so i dint know....i felt...but debugging is about being sure.</p>
<p>0 became 0--, as ppl-=ppl loop continued...</p>
<p>0...has a weird power...to see from a 0....the opportunities...appear.</p>
<p>they are different from your perception of being N</p>
<p>=&gt;logically, one becomes 0 from N...so definitely perception/opportunities are different.</p>
<p>they change as 'intents' show themselves...</p>
<p>thats the real investment of time, life....</p>
<p>ideas, viability on / of ppl...will keep on evolving...</p>
<p>the key is patience/time - life of 0</p>
<p>faith/belief/religion - whatever 1's true 0 is ...remains with them</p>
<p>and then ...power of 0</p>
<p>its awesome coz - its u.</p>
<p>it really doesnt matter what 10000 or 1000000 say.</p>
<p>1 is what made them...0s come in plenty üòÄ </p>

<p>the perception game is just not personal - UN, Muskie, WHO - they all use this 'perception' of being 'good' to do to most 'constructive' work in the world....it is only logical that N meets this choice = aligning to lizard ring of destitution or become 0..</p>
<p>our corp leaders - product of these brands - made by them, know their worth is evaluated by media - hollow/intel inside kind 'leaders' - indian/global -- pappus.</p>

<p>now - if $$ is the issue (it would be - $ is the unsaid religion)</p>
<p>really consider the credit and debit - how they have changed over years - as you got income/age++</p>
<p>the best 0 to compute is bachelor days - the brief period - if any ...when 1 had more $$ than to spend</p>
<p>thats you 'good' 0</p>
<p>then now - the cars, the properties, the emis, or returns - their time value and variance...</p>
<p>the difficult part - the feelings which these 'debts' or assumed 'investments' cause you - things - easy</p>
<p>ppl - v v difficult...</p>
<p>time is the real $$, the money $$ is an illusion - which makes your 0++ - habitus and their 'emotional' expectations</p>
<p>=&gt; your time and its value = the lowest time returns  - yet dependents </p>
<p>some duties, most just emotional debts - the proverbial cockroach jar - which keeps moving in rhythm with "trends" - cool cars, homes, tech - to establish </p>
<p>$$ superiority in order of alfreds.</p>
<p>thats how 1 really knows - what he wants - get skilled++ = ai, tools, tech - all free, all available for anyone..</p>
<p>but then, the real hack is 'looking good', make it till u fake it and all - suckers work, smart ppl earn - the hidden msg in all the stevie jovs, mukerzerx and now - muskie and faultman...</p>
<p>cant fix a tyre - yet 'kings' of their ponds of glory - the title and all..always afraid of not being the psy/op the superman title does to ego - for spouse, kid - etc...not worth it -imho </p>
<p>your 0 - is different from mine</p>
<p>my wants are as unique as my origin story - hence my actions.</p>
<p>a 0 - is knowing this for sure.</p>
<p>$$ money is a tool - can be 'hacked'/borrowed - if u get 'good'</p>
<p>metaverse is really needed for some ppl - wont do well in real 1 üòÇ </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the reason i say $ is the real religion...is simply that most religions require some clothes, some things - festivals and all to really abide and receive blessings - the psy/op of being an eternal sinner/always owed gratitude and all - morality of it</p>
<p>religion of codeparity doesnt require anything - a 0 - just the true cost and money of life - time</p>
<p>the most you know u - the more conscious 1 can be in spending his $$</p>
<p>we live in a world where 'geniuses' are millionaires - skill / passion and all</p>
<p>different programs should produce different outputs to same habitus</p>
<p>but bricks - they are same ... they have to be...the are needed to build empires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the most logical argument to muskie huskie billie - tech god gang is simple..</p>
<p>plug yourselves in - do all the good in the metaverse - shoot yourselves into space - self protection, eat zee bugs - self sustainable and all - report back if it works - we can survive nature - all of us have - 2k years..</p>
<p>dont worry about X / twatter - world worked better before them - launch zee missiles was better than release the immigrants...</p>

<p>Thoth:#3</p>

<p>i have a compass - not the path - still doing the livin - the better version of it.</p>
