<p>Your ideas and posts are truly authentic and real, very thought provoking and practical. Also suggested through your profile that you are just interested in normal publishing of your perspective, away from the craving of being an influencer or top voice. I heartily wish if you also considered in increasing your audience base for a better out-reach as it deserves to be. Thank you for allowing me to be your sincere follower. </p>

<p>the perception - cost of it...</p>

<li>a self serving, virus like creature...</li>

<p>a thing, a pervesion which keeps itself in power, value -through its various shapes - $, doctor, shapeshifting of perception - knowledge, morality, thoughts.</p>
<p>Since linkedin is not a monetizing platform, it seems I needed to hack it - to avoid most obvious perversion of $ and what comes with it</p>
<p>I dont want to be one of those ppl who tell others to read their stuff or follow - but i also believe in choices - sometimes the purest things need most awkward origins - this was a thought - in progress.</p>
<p>whatever has been described, is painfully coming true - and i would have rather loved isolation and irrelevance than becoming ' a told u so guy'</p>
<p>read up, to prepare and anticipate - a stray did it, a 'leader' like u - would get it faster.</p>

<p>it is really easy to improve over a 0</p>

<li>
<p>it is natural</p>

<p>earth/mother supports it</p>

<p>sun/father helps you heal it - stability, adherence, pure will of giving - selflessly</p>

<p>time, days, dates, months - all are % bound tools - which may lure/serpent with a quick fix - emotional, material, avoidance and all...</p>
<p>but it is always a pattern - a recursive 1 - of feelings, money - ppl or $ to earn that 0 of feeling - your happy.</p>
<p>Born unique - to unique parents, lineage, land, circumstances - stack</p>
<p>share common needs, memory - box, habitus, ram, bios</p>
<p>yet - a brick of a sheep, rebooted every month to feel good- a win, no matter what the karma - a win is needed.</p>
<p>This is all the self help anyone needs - ask hard question when 'time' is right.</p>

<p>Mp3 players were not new - they lacked a WalkMen.</p>
<p>Someone saw what music really does - opens up people.</p>
<p>Scientific knowledge of frequency manipulation - using music as a tool to stir up common emotions</p>
<p>war, religion, sorrow - sometimes well deserved, sometimes "hacked" or forced</p>
<p>It all rhymes - when you know what news is going to parrot on, and what the musical 'hack' would be.</p>
<p>napster, iphone - all can be viewed as tests and commercial deployments of these hacks</p>
<p>bitcoin, cdbc</p>
<p>freedom, controlled freedom</p>
<ul>
<li>a pattern </li>
</ul>
<p>baphomet pattern</p>
<p>cia did invest to 'hack' audio - to hack brain - it sounds very 'harry potter' but then, it seems to work - search yt on solfeggio and cia 'astral travel' experiments - munroe institute and all</p>
<p>the scary part - if, and if this is science and true - in 1970s...</p>
<p>then, can there be any capitalistic deployment of such 'invisible' hacks?</p>
<p>🤔 </p>
<p>anyways - hacked a g_baldie_1 sauce seems palpatable ...</p>
<p>the hack works if you know how 'good' you are...</p>
<p>brag before..</p>
<p>brag after...</p>
<p>so here is the "codeparity" war horn - music - a feeling</p>
<ul>
<li>it was sounded in google first - around 2 years back...</li>

<p>now it is the "brag after"</p>

                <p>This real life "deadpool" stuff - live...is kind of enthralling, huh?</p>
<p>It is - but that is the beauty and kind of a harsh realization - it doesnt take much, does it?</p>
<p>The true purpose of any religion is to teach "self sufficiency" to anyone - a soul.</p>
<p>Nihilism forms the base layer for any possibility of even have a chance at evolution - natural.</p>
<p>eg - people concerned about long term food availability or rather their ability to have a decent life with respect and gratitude, cant really make long term decisions - future or kids.</p>
<p>The grand illusion of "charities" or "causes" has always been taking pride in helping someone - which seems which - karmic to me</p>
<ul>
<li>bruce wayne making weapons and using the $$ to eradicate 'hunger' by being dark knight and all.</li>
</ul>
<p>The point at the end of it all is very simple:</p>
<p>Material sufficiency - or knowing ways to ensuring it, is the "prerequisite" to make good decisions - eg delhi, home ministry etc - live everyday.</p>
<p>so the first priority of religion of CodeParity would be always - material sufficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>it doesnt take much - if 1 doesnt plan for imaginary kids, wife, divorce and insurance to compute - after 1 gets "alvida"/bbye - worrying about all this - manifesting to the great tomatoes and world cup...</li>
</ul>
<p>In India - you can be healthy happy &lt; 30K...</p>
<p>addictions extra.</p>
<p>I am not opening any ashram etc - the "feminine" force does take its cost 😀 </p>
<p>just a perspective - an advise from a stray...the earlier you compute your 0, the cheaper it is </p>
<p>you will see all around it - the need to do it, force is "forcing" the 0 on 'genius' ppl - the suit coats, the macs, the iphone cool peeps</p>
<ul>
<li>all 0 when yugas change.</li>
</ul>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feminine = creative  is 1 abstraction i personally believe..</p>
<p>delusional kinds .... there is a reason i have to do this...the same delusion makes me write this 'self help' genre stuff (absolute garbage) but - it is needed.</p>
<p>I found it in a book given by my personal voldermort - the fountainhead..</p>
<p>it stuck to me - the raw irony of it...the 'modern feminist' and its self goals</p>
<p>then someone recoed me 'the art of mcycl maintainance' - the logical way of looking at life and its limitations</p>
<p>thats all the 'philosophy/religion' i needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cheaper = time and money...your real cost...not the hr - "we change the world" or "your contribution is invaluable" blah blah</p>
<p>take home sal / 30 - loans, emi, maintainance etc is true worth of 1s time - stings..but really it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>happiness and 0 are 2 entirely different concepts...</p>
<ul>
<li>i am showing u that live...wait till paw hits...just laying the "groundwork"</li>
</ul>
