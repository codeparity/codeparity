                <p>The "Key"</p>
<p>To debug yourself:</p>
<p>Understand and quantify the "emotion"</p>
<p>eg - right now </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why this guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does he ever work...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>the emotion - curiosity, hate, lurv etc</p>
<p>and i am all those things üòÄ </p>
<ul>
<li>but lets make it about "debugging"</li>
</ul>
<p>Why did 1 feels that - the reason and logic is the key</p>
<p>the thought process goes like this</p>
<p>hate</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i hate his face</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate cox a 0 cannot be "right" - brand always is "company, religion, leader etc"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i hate the "disrespectful-ness"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>to sum it up:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pause, take a breath</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask the "why"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>see - no going to a "quiet" place or "being holy" and all -effienet and hacky as you would like it - engages - the Neo brain (conscious thinking) over impulse.</p>
<p>As an engineer - understanding "why" - to the level of perception i have - was satisfying.</p>
<p>The logic "whys" - the layers to which 1 can debug himselves - the bigger Neo he becomes (Neo-cortex) something which evolves vs the very physical, literal lizard brain we all have.....</p>
<p>//he is delusional , still why i am i reading this??</p>
<p>// ask the "why"</p>

<p>I ll call it "religion" because "religion" is essentially a social protocol which establishes "trust" between people.</p>
<p>The beliefs of this religion would override each and every piece of habitus values any employee may imbibe (economic, religious, abilities, appearance - quantified equality)</p>
<p>And i will quantify them - as i build and commercialize "paw" - open source, self maintainable - build by people with "values".</p>
<p>Merit based on values. </p>

<p>gold/cash allowed you to disconnect from the system - choice</p>
<p>this wont</p>
<p>it is politics, religion, wish of masters - all combined into 1 superpower -money</p>
<p>Masters also seek optimization over sheep</p>
<p>-this "alleged depopulation" - allow ppl do stuff to each other, import neanderthals - raise the % - engineer a clash</p>
<p>whatever remains - eternally grateful sheep - a better palpable version of the neandethals - they took too much mental bandwidth

<p>Blackrock - wont go bankrupt, exactly because of this reason.</p>
<p>If one "influences" the rules, under no "governance", then it also owns the thing we call "money"</p>
<p>Hope the picture is clear - the .1 % elites wont even have to say sorry - the judiciary, the "watchdog poodles" ... no consequences for them - just the sheep</p>
<p>It doesnt mean things would get cheaper, on the contrary - things would get expensive for $ countries - they really dont produce anything apart from their "entitlements" under Intellectual Property</p>
<p>So fake food, eat zee bugs, be happy - take a pill/fentanyl</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>1 book creates neanderthals in middle ease </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>US/world lawmakers, Tech Gods are also "interested" - funding both hamas and Palestine - apparently </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The "progressive" people(big tech)  are all for it </p>
<ul>
<li>California and its residents "like" 12 year old kids taking life altering decisions : https://lnkd.in/dJ6AhctV</li>
</ul>
<p>Some existing laws</p>
<p>-AB 957 : Punishes parents who don‚Äôt ‚Äúaffirm‚Äù their child‚Äôs trans identity</p>
<p>-SB 107: Removes an out-of-state child from their parents if the child travels to California to obtain gender transition procedures</p>
<p>-SB 145: Reduced penalty for offenders who sodomize chiIdren as young as 14</p>
<p>-SB 866: Allows kids to consent to medical decisions without parental knowledge</p>
<ul>
<li>SB 132: Requires prisons to put males in female prisons if they claim to feel like a woman</li>
</ul>
<p>The above 'laws' might well be written in arabic or urdu - would make much sense</p>
<p>Education is being "updated" to catch us up : https://lnkd.in/dMrvTX2i</p>
<p>If $ can be considered a man made thing... what can one call this "fascination" with other people's kids???</p>
<p>To me, money is just the "razmatazz" which hides the very underbelly of "capitalism" and its illogical implementation - a very primeval, neanderthal control - religion created to make 'ancient, mindless weapons"</p>
<p>It works</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to keep masses under control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>programmed for a crash, if allowed to go on - masters are always needed with wisdom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a virus which feeds on an organism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a "genius" virus that doesnt realize - life of organism is essential for virus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no logical explanation of  feeding "a religion" - recursive, non intelligent algorithm </p>
<p>The followers are part of the control, a very "genius" and ancient one </p>
<ul>
<li>smart people ask for money, these ones do it for free.</li>

<p>Binary search in "setting expectation"</p>
<p>"News" or the "feelings" conveyed by it - can be disturbing and moving</p>
<p>One of the patterns of masters - is using "binary search" in reverse - to find or set the social / moral compass</p>
<p>Neanderthals were always neanderthals - they might think of themselves as "khalifa" and all, they are the pointer of "low expectations of society" - used by brit masters</p>
<p>Terrorism, "Un-ignorable acts of violence" etc - something to go to war to</p>
<p>They always happened - kashmir, pakistan, bangladesh - internal to - courtesy "genius" "tech wizard" home minister and his "genius" team</p>
<p>but now it serves a purpose - to play the final hand for $$ - the need which cannot be ignored - war - missiles etc</p>
<p>West - high pointer</p>
<p>Middle east - low pointer</p>
<p>we - the 99% in between - making choices, but choosing is irrelevant</p>

<p>aliens.</p>
<p>-&gt; they came from somewhere.</p>
<p>-&gt;&gt; travel, fuel</p>
<p>-&gt;&gt;&gt; energy solutions</p>
<p>Oil ...</p>
<p>Ppl holding the world "hostage" for it - since "industrialization"</p>
<p>money, buys "truth" eg -&gt; al jazeera, cnn, bbc etc</p>
<p>A "red" practice can be repainted as "green"</p>
<p>News/Incidents/culture - can be suppressed.</p>
<p>Now</p>
<p>The .01% rich "white ones" know.</p>
<p>They dont really care about religion, just their place in the world - considering "oil" may go bbye - it anyways was - sun, renewable etc.</p>
<p>this all, is obviously a delusional scenario</p>
<p>What would a "culture" about to be "irrelevant" do?</p>
<p>Come at full force, afterall, they "might" be a trigger force for a larger truth - the upper layer - money.</p>
<p>Money needs to change hands - it would. </p>
<p>Delusional??</p>
<p>just check the dates on the posts/articles.</p>
<p>how is nasdaq doing?</p>
