<p>it simply was a test of times to come...and people chose it over religion - hardware, electricity, internet, money - all to lay ground to create an absolutely loyal following of souls - a new digital religion</p>
<p>like real estate or anything really - "value" can be an illusion and there cannot be a bigger example</p>
<p>those rigs...the valuation of ai hw and sw industry..it is all seems like an illusion - a choice made by each of us everyday for dependence on these entities - the tech gods or the stock gods - the enterprises</p>

<p>money - has different forms - influence, relative/perceived beautify and the mass truth/hysteria/hopium ppl are wishing for...</p>
<p>to defeat this matrix...one has to truly win on these individual matrices..financial, spiritual and material....</p>
<p>as i tried sharing earlier - hacking is an art, which is much older than computers.</p>
<p>a good hackers knows the layers and the entry/exchange point of protocols between these layers.</p>
<p>brit masters - learn from them - a true homage to a master, yet a true test of evolution </p>
<p>Akuma's birth - goki was happy in his final moments - his success was his pupil's success - a true test...a conclusion of a successful life.</p>
<p>Akuma, like money is not evil or good - it just serves a purpose. </p>

<p>and if you really look into past 10-15 years...- the world has been food sufficient - only to be constrained by fake $ and the "generosities" of billionaires</p>
<p>the rulers need a divide - and they had and used many - color, creed, religion, nationality etc.... </p>
<p>fun fact - passports were an invention of "world wars" - which one may argue - were directly or indirectly fuelled and needled by all knowing masters in london - following vatican.</p>

<p>The canada thing - should be the confirmation of the unfortunate, illogical, invisible, yet very real "war" we are part of</p>
<p>a side which wants to claim humanity hacking its nihilistic/animistic tendencies - coz morality is so out of fashion...ai, lowering age of consent etc is the way to go...</p>
<p>the other side...which has always been defending with "jugaad" - survival with whatever gratitude one can offer</p>
<p>the war which largely people of the world are blind to...and thats is the real reason unique cultures are a threat to '15 min cities"/universal capitalistic harmony/safe/provided for/free money and hence - freedom</p>
<p>we are in a war - and it is sort of biblical... i dont think many people are aware of it...hence this.</p>
