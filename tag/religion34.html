<p>thats what really my 24 hours are worth - no matter which fruity story the people in "human resources" had me believe.</p>
<p>This money decides the "ability to get justice" - hire the top lawyer or other measures - it is really a perspective</p>
<p>A flawed justice system, with self appointed judges - worldwide</p>
<p>we were in 1 world govt already - now better "efficiency" is expected.</p>
<p>So here comes the new online safety bill - now govt can snoop legally to "determine" if you were being "unsafe"!!</p>

<p>Lets follow the timeline here</p>
<p>once upon a time, Vatican made its mission to spread religion to the globe</p>
<p>it largely succeeded </p>
<p>the ppl in hollywood decide -" religion is so 70s" (just after gold standard was abolished")</p>
<p>for the 1st time - the church is OK with all the computer revolution and the free educative videos out there...</p>
<p>then the universal basics of morality - the 7 sins were phased out and made fun of</p>
<p>now - with vax, tax and unemployment - it is quite predictable - ppl wont even be able to speak their mind online - leave apart the real world where ppl already live for society approval with loans and cars of "amazing" value.</p>
<p>ppl with pent up anger and anxiety: with no way of dealing with it....fentnyl makes sense now - this is not at all predictable</p>
<p>i think masters planned this all along - we trust them too much!!</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Stars are shining, stocks are up - world is singing to your tune</p>
<p>Rejoice, for humanity has birthed its tech "savior"</p>
<p>....this was few years back</p>
<p>then, it became about freedom and claiming it back</p>
<p>....dems/libs are out of control - he says</p>
<p>It is harvest time now, so forget all that</p>
<p>...now attach your biometrics to get a 160 character, "free" voice - so fair!!</p>
<p>summarizing the context:</p>
<p>twitter was about communication - it served a purpose of worldwide "broadcast"</p>
<p>conspiracy ppl call it propoganda - "virality"/"the sob stories", "the proud moments", etc-  ( recommendations blah blah algos which every "big tech" engg crams up, only to never use 😎 ) </p>
<ul>
<li>talk to a real engg, and he will tell you how financially "insane" a M+ fanout global model looks like - it was never financially viable - based on "fanout" alone</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;It served a global purpose of global sync of ppl. </p>
<p>eg farmer agitations in India getting morality lectures from PMs who cancelled bank accounts of their "dissenting" citizens</p>
<p>Now money is not money- but a token.</p>
<p>a token which may allow you to tweet, communicate with "rightly suggested" people (based on location, occupation, pay - sheep stable etc)</p>
<p>X is about global money, it makes sense too</p>
<p>=ai to "generate content", neuralink to "conjure" the content on fly..., tesla to take you around (till its "safe")...and X to do "everything"</p>
<p>WEF likey global money, global society, no religion, no diversity.</p>
<p>-just diversity in the "kind" of people, </p>
<p>NOT</p>
<p>in what they consume.</p>
<p>or read</p>
<p>or believe</p>
<p>or eat</p>
<p>or think</p>
<ul>
<li>just few saviors, who were there in time, to do the right things, when "people" needed them</li>
</ul>
<p>What option do we have - worldcoin seems evil, so go with muskie!!!</p>
<p>A pattern -  like last 100 years of west - create 2 divides, both do the same, but speak in different dialects.</p>
<p>Overplayed? No, i think there is still a lot of "trust" left....</p>

<p>Religious ppl have a specific name in the Bible - the deceiver, false light prophet etc...</p>

<p>there seem to be a sacred law - they never lie, only deceive/divert</p>
<p>I am just stumped by how accurate some of the depictions are .... and how eroded the faith of a normal human is - in any of the religions - convenient to knit-pick without adhering to the values any of them prescribes.

                <p>Rx - a symbol mostly popular for use in medical prescriptions has as lot more going for it</p>
<p>-It may mean a controlled or prescribed burn (RX) in context of "fires"</p>
<p>-In "genetics", it is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RAX gene.The RAX gene is located on chromosome 18 in humans, mice, and rats.</p>
<p>there seems to be an awkward relevance to these "less known" interpretations to this symbol</p>
<p>The wikipedia entry seems "suggestive"</p>
<p>".</p>
<p>Controlled burns on Australian savannas can result in an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring "strategic fire management across 28,000 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi) of Western Arnhem Land" to partially offset greenhouse gas emissions from a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin, Australia.</p>

<p>the other one - 'genetics' related .... is being pushed in our lives by "prescriptions" and "subscriptions" - viruses, flues, vax etc</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dfMHYiTH</p>
<p>symbols seem important - they do have a story to tell, and it may turn out to be an important story to know.</p>

<p>Symbols seem like an "exchange" of sorts</p>
<p>people invest in it, masses trust it - it makes money flow in a practical/capitalistic world</p>
<p>the choice of symbols is curious - reptoid symbols stand out - medical, $ money, doctor etc</p>
<p>it is a purest "investment" in a capitalistic world - the word of snake - the demiurge of the world - recognizing and pledging your allegiance - soul and material</p>
<p>it delivers too...but it doesnt "evolve"</p>
<p>evolution can be different from what we perceive. The vedas dint write themselves, and the "dark ages" might really be the "light ages"</p>
<p>The pyramids, the left over temples in south - are impossible to build even today</p>
<p>dark ages?? 😀

<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The X in new twatter is curious, isnt it?</p>
<p>the makhichoos paid so much money for it.....a "brand" was destroyed...</p>
<p>it must mean something significant, important.</p>
<p>There is some incentive for people to force these symbols on us.</p>
<p>it is costly, ugly and defies capitalism</p>
<p>still, it flew</p>
<p>Inversion of symbols is a common concept. Swastika still being inverted and appropriated by west as 'Hakenkreuz' is the most prominent example of a religion/tribe being psychologically brainwashed into not using it</p>
<p>it inverted form - 'Hakenkreuz' still is defined as "swastika" in all white/master/genius ppl literature</p>
<p>who cares about correcting them ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X - It seems like an inverted cross to me, but why should i care....the people who "invest" in this symbol in its non inverted form seem to forget what it represents...a union of horizontal and the vertical</p>
<p>a sort of balance between what can be characterized as feminine/adaptability/humility - the horizontal and the strength of a vertical structure - typically classified as masculine</p>
<p>=&gt; now being reduced as a union of none - a single entity which is all consuming, all powerful</p>
<p>there is not much to symbols, it is intuitive if you "constellate" correctly - as the unknown prophet says and guides</p>

                <p>Was that it?</p>
<p>No, 😂 ... not by a long shot.</p>
<p>The posts/articles were just a way to highlight the hypocrisy of "linkedin"/"compliant" world - where "likes" and "shares" determine the "popularity" or establish "truth" &gt; in a world where people fear thinking.</p>
<p>It is not fear exactly, but a sort of decision "fatigue" which the "leaders" of the world keep exhausting us with - unable to regain focus or think for us, rather than on "job"</p>
<p>There are people and organizations which have things "handled" - welcome to a world of our making</p>
<p>=&gt;this would be the first global generation which would actually fail the nature course of progress, prosperity, enrichment via evolution, learning, time </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eg, the next generation would really own less of - land, gold, food </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dependent on vax, free money, and artificial food and supply</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So keep those likes and those "atta bois" to yourself - lick them, treasure them as your stars of "compliance" </p>
<p>a stray is about to show what "impact" few "stray/unapproved" values/ideas can create - holy batman you are in for a fight.</p>
<p>Values = New Capitalistic religion</p>
<p>Material = "free/sustainable" energy - distributed istyle so "genius" kind cannot put it behind "human safety" concerns - as "leaders" will end up doing with AI, as done with nuclear</p>
<p>Btw, why nuclear waste disposal on moon, or in a black hole is a 'bad idea'? when all nations do is dump their waste on each other??</p>

<p>I have unfollowed so many of you...and it was for a purpose - i dont really care, and it should tell all of you something - we were never in the same league</p>
<p>Humility should not be confused with "subservience"/inferiority or equivalence</p>
<p>thats all for "linkedin" - i will see ppl in real world now....caz it takes less time to "show magic" rather than "talk magic"</p>
<p>i am no jerusalem historian faking as futurist,</p>
<p>i am just a stray engineer who really unlearned and learned...if it is not showing in words, it will show in "impact"</p>

<p>In honor of open source, even ideas or fairness in a decent world - search CIA declassified files on free energy </p>
<p>Thats why UAP are different from UFOs?</p>
<p>DArpa controls innovation - ever wondered why we waste 2 bytes even today? in a world where bit packing seemed to rule a real engineers life</p>
<p>lets see who really cracks it - it is all in the design baby!</p>
