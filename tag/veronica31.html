<p>govt - collect tax, fund abdul - 'good life' </p>

<p>last - pets - dogs etc... = well, tax them too</p>

<p>This would sound quite 'idealistic' - yet it is the 1 time tested rule which has stood the test of time - from my 0th job to Nth </p>
<p>Understanding of "vision" with values of the 'company' determine your relative success/failure =&gt; career</p>
<p>Values - what goes in the company</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what counts as 'humor'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what counts as 'obscene'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what counts as 'good behavior'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>this kiddy stuff - gets in way of cool peeps - try to bend the 'boundaries' as per title/seniority++</p>
<p>I will give examples</p>
<p>telco startup 1 : </p>
<p>values : what happened in ariscent ( corp fork off of Huggies Saftware Systems)</p>
<p>Vision : what ariscent does</p>
<p>telco startup 2:</p>
<p>values : money</p>
<p>vision : release</p>
<p>result : a release and a 'merger' - genius 'mentors' - and they still demand 'respect'</p>
<p>apps startup 1:</p>
<p>values : hot harem</p>
<p>vision : hot harem ++</p>
<p>result : harem costed the company</p>
<p>telco startup 3:</p>
<p>values : money</p>
<p>vision : hot harem</p>
<p>result : a release and a 'merger' - again!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>boogle : "dheela naada" 😍 </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>all that blah blah - to ask the real question - "know what you are getting into"</p>
<p>ask the fruity question on vision and values </p>
<ul>
<li>dont get into 'morality'...</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on money</p>
<p>health, skill</p>
<p>respect</p>
<p>Just simple things - to become a stray like this -&gt;. 🤣 </p>
<p>naah - understand the 'hacks' to ! get hacked - baldies and their glory is decades old 'genius'..</p>
<p>would take atleast a decade to finally get them in ...</p>

<p>the reason i made an example of g_baldies when there are n more 'good lookin' baldies....</p>
<p>general baldies have some stakes on table - their reputation, money or even veronica - they own the decision, hence the outcome...</p>
<p>with g_baldies - they used g_money to hire g_veronicas - obviously on their smartness and niceness/values parameters - all known from past : lurvly father figures ..</p>

<p>it is not like baldies can give this 'career' up... their addiction is society approved - fame, glory and being pioneer of blah...</p>

<p>A reoccurring concept planted by genius ppl in hollywood - infinite multiverses...</p>
<p>every photon divides itself - seemingly 'randomly' - to create a chain of 'frames' or 'memories/events' which compose 1s life...</p>
<p>to simplify....</p>
<p>a life = memory[timestamp]</p>
<p>acc to 'genius' ppl...its more like this</p>
<p>life = memory [multiverse_n][timestamp]</p>
<p>with multiverse_n - being a 'sacred' variable - science' final frontier etc...time travel or Avengers Endgame...</p>
<p>with marvel science - they have us believe in 'time branches' - aka sparce matrix - memory[multiverse_x] is only init or alloc when x is 'referenced'...</p>
<p>“Do you really believe that the moon isn’t there when nobody looks?” </p>
<p>―  Albert Einstein </p>
<p>... this all 'science'...if 1 believes in it..</p>
<p>=&gt; choice is an illusion</p>
<p>==&gt; a multiverse exists where an alternate 'choice' was made by u.</p>
<p>convenient </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>1 can get the dichotomy of logic here?</p>
<p>Tarot and Quantum theory - they are quite similar 😂 </p>

<p>for java peeps...even if some are still trying - i love u...</p>
<p>i ll clarify the 'dichotomy'</p>
<p>quantum science tells us 'choice' is made in alternate universe...so memory allocation  is already done...</p>
<p>but the marvel science says memory allocation is done on the fly...ie when u create a 'branch'..</p>
<p>see - clear contradiction.</p>
<p>(memory management -  its is magic that java does 4 u)</p>

<p>my logic on 'multiverses' is quite 'lazy' - yeah, right...show me, till then, i will try to 0++</p>
