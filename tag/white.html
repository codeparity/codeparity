                <p>The decline of gaming : effects of $/oil capitalism/intents</p>
<p>DEI content being pushed via gaming : is already known</p>
<p>I am about fighting games and 'characters'</p>
<p>I never understood the economics of it </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>why suddenly games stopped being 'logical'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they seem to 'deter' from the 'philosophy'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>i played 2/3 games at local sensei levels : sf, kof and 'violent storm' 😀 </p>
<p>all these games : made by capcom/snk - all Japan</p>
<p>but last few iterations : sf5, kof 14+ </p>
<p>has some stink of toilet paper and oil</p>
<p>khalifa characters : being introduced as 'main's</p>
<p>'rasheed' : was the protagonist for sf V 🤣 </p>
<p>the country whose national food should be KFC</p>
<p>see, you cant really keep Dhalsim as rep of 1.5 B peeps in this age</p>
<p>yet have an imaginary googley glass wearing khalifa defying game mechanics and hence - laziness</p>
<p>no wonder oil is not good for body 😀 </p>
<p>they fried the gaming world with their cheap oil intellect and 'vision'</p>
<p>hence this constant 'balancing' and weird non sensical new characters</p>
<p>hence : gorou : the mark of wolves.</p>
<p>rasheed : the all knowing, fast googley glass fantasy of green intellect, polluting the franchise..</p>
<p>no play.</p>

<p>in sf - there was not a horizontal safe move - that seemed like a golden rule</p>

                <p>Energy : </p>
<p>seems like a good parameter to debug last few decades/centuries</p>
<p>energy : is needed to 'create' things fast </p>
<p>oil/coal based electric : seems most convenient</p>
<p>So if few green peeps/countries have that 'energy'</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they 'value' and sell it </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all hypothetical</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as much or little </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as the tire headgear wearing khalifa decides : with 'white' intellect</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>$ started valuing 'energy' : petro$</p>
<p>lets say this true value of human capital - men, efforts, food, goods etx</p>
<p>is exchanged 50/50 between white and supreme khalifa green peeps</p>
<p>so they do what they do with this 'value' exchange of $ and %</p>
<p>white : do sciencey stuff - ensuring this 'economics of lack, war and reboots'</p>
<p>greeen : made artificial towers/ earth , climate and 'dreamed' of approval/respect : of not doing anything moral - ever.</p>
<p>maybe - thats the reason, fission/fusion and most electric methods are 'bad'</p>
<p>thats the world - which is being challenged right now..</p>
<p>both these klans - built fake countries and intents, based on fake $ and real oil..</p>
<p>and multiplied these 'intents' by books and free glam - fb, games, and fame</p>
<p>maybe to ensure 'supply' of 'finer things in life'</p>
<p>Just another 'energy' based insight into decoding 'real' </p>
<ul>
<li>religions, heroes, beliefs, countries and their 'progress'</li>

<p>i has to understand how 'precarious' this oil economy is</p>

<p>the white bathrobes - as skilled they are in their superiority and fine fabrics..</p>
<p>have nothing to 'exchange' their oil for.</p>
<p>hence no one goes to desert</p>
<p>no eco hub, tax rebates make no sense when there is no 'energy' to buy/sell via states</p>

                <p>Plugging in - the tower of babylon story with now..</p>
<p>the story seems important.</p>
<p>If it was true, maybe there was a time when few civilizations went all hippy and tried to reach heavens - maybe to talk to 'god'</p>
<p>But that tower was destroyed and that common 'language and beliefs' were fragmented.</p>
<p>I can only relate to it as a ww 'like' event in those times.</p>
<p>And humans, no matter how civilized they are - when competing for 'less' fight for survival.</p>
<p>the snakeyness - is logical : it is what keeps us alive.</p>
<p>Hence my delusional analogy to 'now'..</p>
<p>wars - are meant to 'fragment'</p>
<p>for few old forces to re-invent itself...</p>
<p>a new matrix...rebooted..</p>
<p>with all new improvements : which are needed.</p>
<p>They hint at in the matrix series.</p>
<p>The irony : even if 1 crashes the matrix, zion has no 'room'</p>
<p>maybe, 'cipher' was a realist, who just was logical enough to believe in the song "wake me up...when u gogo" 😂 </p>
<p>coz he gets to have a 'stake', coz there is no trinity for him</p>
<p>And hence my final ? for the fans of matrix</p>
<p>Agent Smith : was really the 'hero', forced to do what needed for 'humans' to stay alive?</p>
<p>cox for him, he was explicit - in exiting the matrix, it meant freedom for him - human live/no live : no care</p>
<p>coz the matrix : wasnt producing anything new ....</p>
<p>even neo : wasnt new...</p>
<p>their lurv...is a good story...but its just that : a love story?</p>

<p>religions : are often birthed at these times </p>
<p>nuziness : is a religion - borne out of 'superiority'</p>
<p>same is every religion...</p>
<p>logic of this : religions - are xombies of past - which solved for 'then' </p>
<p>not 'now'...</p>
<p>another ? for religious peeps...</p>
<p>so much time and money - to study obsolete packages..</p>
<p>worth it? unless it becomes a job. </p>

<p>Thoth:#2</p>

<p>maybe even that 'universal religion' was 'fragmented'...</p>
<p>and peeps wrote their own version of it - what they recalled.</p>
<p>the peeps : who got 'desert' : have to be 'that' 🐍 </p>
<p>who got cold : had to 'heat' to survive, weapons to fight 'nature' : white peeps</p>
<p>and maybe...some peeps had it all : yellow 1s..</p>
<p>just that : soft men -&gt; hard times...</p>
<p>is just too predictable.</p>
<p>delusions have no end 😀 </p>

<p>Isnt "ai" - like a tool to destroy the new tower of matrix - internet</p>
<p>xoz now : truth would be told by ai : assistants and their 'summary'</p>
<p>and all research would be done by then</p>
<p>it is nice - neuralink and eat zee bugs : play video games or enjoi on the fly content - as tapped in by 'neuralink' - as painted on fly by 'ai' - who ever, whatever and - it is all paid for : progress : coz u ll be happy.</p>
<p>it is really alluring - this picture of 'progress'</p>

<p>if anything....1 gotta see that humans : were made perfect by default..</p>
<p>in different flavors - coz hey : thats spice...and logical : diversified dna pool...which is driven by nature to spot and attract 'opposite' or unseen..</p>
<p>and we got peeps who believe they sinned...and need to atone for some historical sin...when food is there, tech is there...and shortages : are manufactured...</p>
<p>coz the 33 degress of supremeness : sees this-&gt;. as a virus..</p>
<p>a necessary bakra, coz hey : even homelander needs peeps to stay relevant..</p>
<p>it just keeps the life : interesting and engaging..gives it meaning.</p>
<p>coz those few ancestories who have really sinned and aligned their lives to "that" probably have no chance if theory of 'ancestral karma' is true.</p>
<p>for them : it is elongation of life, coz their karma is overflowing and cant be settled for the stuff - 1 neanderthal monekey gene x superior race wants years ++ , and would do all the 'science' : to deny death?</p>
<p>just another delusion 😀  </p>

<p>and last logical question : if energy is all what machines needed...</p>

<p>This is all hypothetic, bleh blah of the force which brit masters/bankers serve</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>child traffikers, adrenochome harvesters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>green/white peeps - who 'sacrifice' a goat/whatever as 'penance' of they year round sin they are indoctrinated to commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in their ignorance/awareness : seems like a matter of 'rank/awareness' - 33 degress of rose crux clan based 'wisdom'</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The base emotion is fear - uncertainty, anxiety etx</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>whether 1 is white or green or hybrid like Amits of the world...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the 1s who rule/sigma etx - build a perception that this 'fear' is conquered by them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the pappus -rejoice : they have a model puppa to fondle and follow around</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>same structure - alfred jobs - computers, tech etx</p>
<p>or abdul jobs : mechanical, tire patching or just general 'dreamy/feely' life</p>
<p>or politicos : sigma rules, rest follows</p>
<p>It gives an understanding of this 'power struct' </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the 1s which baphomet feels close to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collect and help harvest this cycle of fear of </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>god being unkind, do 'job' as 'boss' says</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>so bapho bakra god - likies fear...</p>
<p>the whole world is build for it - make servants : forked in mind since childhood - choice of logic or feel as 'compulsory' </p>
<p>How do u cull such a creature?</p>
<p>it likies fear...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>eve emotions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rage would feed it...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>....</p>
<p>it requires logic and wit...</p>
<p>rick and morty had ideas...</p>
<p>coz i see baldies/pappus = jerries...</p>

<p>snake - a creature that is addicted to -ve feels ... </p>
<p>it is a tool, a species - nagas : which just benefit from this -ve feely artificial world...</p>
<p>keep showing what 'happy' is ...</p>
<p>1 s happy becomes 'life quest' - disappointments, sed lyf etx = -ve emos</p>
<p>snakies just act managerial in it...</p>
<p>it is the snake which inside brain - nihilistic 1 : which gives in - telling itself 'consumption' is life...</p>
<p>just a convenient cope out for few 'gurus' - which seem to look into 'unknown' yet not asking for solutions for 'known'</p>
