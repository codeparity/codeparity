                <p>Human hacking or psy/ops - is very real and very potent</p>
<p>should be part of base education - helps in discovery of "you"</p>
<p>This is about "hacking" from outside. </p>
<p>What if these ppl were the "insiders"?</p>
<p>will they hire to carry on "white collar crimes" or grey corp/capitalistic espionage ?</p>
<p>I think they do, it explains why they will hire "baldies" with "decades" old experience - the "data" is the gold.</p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the cloud game - full of out of date baldies - who sold "boxes"</p>
<p>suddenly they are needed at "cloud leadership"</p>
<p>none of these guys can really explain cloud to a newbie engineer - they never used it - only preach it.</p>
<p>the pnb thing - hiring of the orakle leadership - was due to their in-prem deployment. GOI forbade cloud in banking long ago - still "detailed account plans" are needed by baldie alfred</p>
<p>i dont think even he knew- he was busy chasing his "golden" bone out of country which treated his as per his "aukaat"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>cloud is a "apps" thing - roi/risk is manageable</p>
<p>the "enterprise" part - someone running those servers at superior bandwith, with less cost (discounts etc)</p>
<p>sometimes the discounts wont even justify the "electric cost"</p>
<p>but, they are offered = "strategically"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I dint learn it on purpose - i was on "receiving" end of it.</p>
<p>Always trying to "reverse engineer" - I dint react as i was expected to....initially i did, but you learn</p>
<p>it becomes increasingly evident - the internal "broadcast messaging" - they things, portfolios, the kind of companies/assets they are after....telecom/banking are the "highest" priority, then the nihilistic layers - water, land, agri, electric - whatever the host govt would "allow" them to do</p>
<p>colorado usa - they destroyed a whole city, a river with countless animals to set up the "cloud farms"</p>
<p>yet, the 'news' is their 'fren' so you ll never hear it</p>
<p>just how "big tech" cares - planted trees, green campus and glory...</p>
