                <p>Rx - a symbol mostly popular for use in medical prescriptions has as lot more going for it</p>
<p>-It may mean a controlled or prescribed burn (RX) in context of "fires"</p>
<p>-In "genetics", it is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RAX gene.The RAX gene is located on chromosome 18 in humans, mice, and rats.</p>
<p>there seems to be an awkward relevance to these "less known" interpretations to this symbol</p>
<p>The wikipedia entry seems "suggestive"</p>
<p>".</p>
<p>Controlled burns on Australian savannas can result in an overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. One working example is the West Arnhem Fire Management Agreement, started to bring "strategic fire management across 28,000 square kilometres (11,000 sq mi) of Western Arnhem Land" to partially offset greenhouse gas emissions from a liquefied natural gas plant in Darwin, Australia.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>the other one - 'genetics' related .... is being pushed in our lives by "prescriptions" and "subscriptions" - viruses, flues, vax etc</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dfMHYiTH</p>
<p>symbols seem important - they do have a story to tell, and it may turn out to be an important story to know.</p>

<p>Symbols seem like an "exchange" of sorts</p>
<p>people invest in it, masses trust it - it makes money flow in a practical/capitalistic world</p>
<p>the choice of symbols is curious - reptoid symbols stand out - medical, $ money, doctor etc</p>
<p>it is a purest "investment" in a capitalistic world - the word of snake - the demiurge of the world - recognizing and pledging your allegiance - soul and material</p>
<p>it delivers too...but it doesnt "evolve"</p>
<p>evolution can be different from what we perceive. The vedas dint write themselves, and the "dark ages" might really be the "light ages"</p>
<p>The pyramids, the left over temples in south - are impossible to build even today</p>
<p>dark ages?? 😀

<p>The X in new twatter is curious, isnt it?</p>
<p>the makhichoos paid so much money for it.....a "brand" was destroyed...</p>
<p>it must mean something significant, important.</p>
<p>There is some incentive for people to force these symbols on us.</p>
<p>it is costly, ugly and defies capitalism</p>
<p>still, it flew</p>
<p>Inversion of symbols is a common concept. Swastika still being inverted and appropriated by west as 'Hakenkreuz' is the most prominent example of a religion/tribe being psychologically brainwashed into not using it</p>
<p>it inverted form - 'Hakenkreuz' still is defined as "swastika" in all white/master/genius ppl literature</p>
<p>who cares about correcting them ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>X - It seems like an inverted cross to me, but why should i care....the people who "invest" in this symbol in its non inverted form seem to forget what it represents...a union of horizontal and the vertical</p>
<p>a sort of balance between what can be characterized as feminine/adaptability/humility - the horizontal and the strength of a vertical structure - typically classified as masculine</p>
<p>=&gt; now being reduced as a union of none - a single entity which is all consuming, all powerful</p>
<p>there is not much to symbols, it is intuitive if you "constellate" correctly - as the unknown prophet says and guides</p>

<p>in a weird way...joker respects balance and the ability of society to self correct itself...no matter how tragic the events leading upto it might be - true Christianity, Karma - all good religious stuff</p>

<p>in white knight fashion - he can choose to legalize or control anything - law, influence or money - all at his disposal - the 3 forms of matrix..</p>
<p>..yet he puts on a cape to rescue....with whole of capitalism at its disposal</p>
<p>he is as self destructive ....even more so as the joker.....</p>

                <p>Great News : FedNow is launching this month 🎉🎉🎉</p>
<p>https://lnkd.in/dB4iJnmz</p>
<p>This is a landmark - i think it would "help" a lot of people in developed countries in "reclaiming" their "lifestyle"</p>
<p>Enterprises like whiterock, asguard etc cant fail because of exactly this reason - they seem like fronts for private citizens/nice masters to "free" the rest</p>
<p>It is a freedom of sorts - to own nothing.</p>
<p>saving or hoarding money is kind of opposite to the wef version of happy freedom</p>
<p>money/assets tied up in this system - is it really "money"???</p>
<p>fednow cdbc freedom innovation smartcontracts smartcities </p>

<p>After Thoughts</p>
<p>Thoth:#1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This "money" seems more like a timer to exist in the world.</p>
<p>Not issued by Gods, but by tech gods.</p>
<p>AI/IOT/smart farming, smart dogs, smart cars, TVs - they suddenly make sense with this "smart money" ... tech god/masters giving permission to fellow sheep to exist for a time...in a particular way, eating zee bugs, coz earth is bad coz of climate change, sun and aliens etc...</p>
<p>a realistic realization of Wef version of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thoth:#2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If one considers "time" as an important/schedulable parameter - aliens, viruses, wars, ai, climate change</p>
<p>our masters so considerate and timely in their efforts to "save" us....</p>
<p>btw, unkle billy pediatric MAP gates is a part of this too...</p>
<p>1 should know to explore the rabbit hole by now, else 1 might end up owing/signing to an illusion of "fear"</p>
<p>sheep and wolves etc blah blah</p>
