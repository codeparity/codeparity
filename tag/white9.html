                <p>Demand supply and fake $$ money</p>
<p>....a delusional flow chart of 'now" : $$ world</p>
<p>Demand:</p>
<p>who makes material stuff - the 'affordable' 1s - CN</p>
<p>Is CN a democracy - lets "assume" "NO" 😀 </p>
<p>So what decides CN's policies</p>
<p>XI?</p>
<p>XI is dependent on 'quorum' of his cn_peeps </p>
<p>cn_peeps keep 'nice' till nihilistic needs are met </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>nice life - food, woo/man and 'pleasures'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the illusion of 'fairness' </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now cn_peeps are not 'happy'</p>
<p>XI 's real 'dependence' - world should 'need' him - for everything!!</p>
<p>Oh he has a 'strategie' a sophisticated 1 </p>
<p>money is fake</p>
<p>demand is real</p>
<p>grab the 'demand' </p>
<p>choke the 'potential</p>
<p>=&gt; flood the '1 CN world' with 'affordable' yet always new needy things - phones, lights - all plasticky stuff</p>
<p>=&gt; buy 'influence' -&gt; invest - ppl, politicos, brands, land, foreign police stations,etx</p>
<p>=&gt; buy 'psy/op' -. tikky tokkie, dance and bytes, financial 5 footiya genius -maa s</p>
<p>==&gt; though $$ is the force which world runs on, the real thing is 'demand' and 'supply' </p>
<p>===&gt; sustained 'demand' and we 'supply', $$ =&gt; Y$B (who cares)</p>
<p>Kinda 'nice'</p>
<p>Then we have the 'brit masters' - the awesome ones</p>
<p>"Free" a country </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>coz we left, it was right thing to do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>coz we fair ppl are really fair</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt; just create 'divides' to hack</p>
<p>==&gt; law, justice policing, 2 party democraxy, parliament, press, intellectuals etc</p>
<p>===&gt; oh we will give 'respect' - make the colony as a ground for makin 'complaint alfreds'</p>
<p>=====&gt; alfreds are 'grateful' - thats their 'purpose'</p>
<p>just for redundancies, we will 'popularize' their 'culture' - religion, livin</p>
<p>coz toilet paper - it is 'white' - it is what 'pope' recommends.</p>
<p>aww, no gratitude in 'brown peeps' - we the nordic/aryan/blah ones need to 'save' humanity</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>CO2 is bad</p>
<p>SUN is bad</p>
<p>U ppl - dont know 'science'</p>
<p>U need us</p>
<p>buy an ev, become a fanboi to do a 9-5 shtick</p>
<p>that casa aint gonna pay for itself....</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>=&gt; how do we 'scale it'???</p>
<p>Lets hire a guy who is willing</p>
<ul>
<li>XI</li>
</ul>
<p>then there are some oil holders - praying/forcing their relevance in this wider 'evolution' of 'humanity'...</p>
<p>Quite a 'simple game' ?</p>
<p>Yet, going on for 'decades', probably centuries.</p>
<p>Aions/Yugas - the change of 'the game"?</p>
<p>I surely hope so. 😀 </p>

<p>i know me - used that 'knowledge' to tame the experienced gBullies - now maybe xooglers,  many in making.</p>

<p>'googlers' - the word ppl would get engraved on their tomb stones - if society allowed it 😀 </p>

<p>no products in line - just more 'promises' of success.</p>
<p>value was created - it was taken from the brand and its admirers</p>
<p>value, which should follow 'newtons' law of emotions'
